Why do swallowed hormones (e.g. The pill) work? Shouldn't the acid & proteases render them non-functional?,,"The gastrointestinal tract does indeed present barriers to reliable absorption of medicine taken by mouth. That said, all of the medicines which are totally incapable of being absorbed through the GI tract have one thing in common: You don't take them as pills. (There's so many other non-oral routes: Intravenous, intraosseous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, sublingual, buccal, intranasal, transdermal, intrathecal, rectal...) Anyway, let's say you have a medication that's sensitive to stomach acid. You'd want an enteric coating to get it safely to the gut. This can also spare the stomach from drugs that irritate it, like aspirin. (Though there's times where the faster release of a non-enteric aspirin is preferable, like a heart attack.) Proteases chop up proteins and peptides, which only applies to a small fraction of medications. (Oral contraceptives contain various versions of steroid hormones, which are closer to cholesterol than any protein.) Insulin is the big one, which is why it always comes by some kind of needle or tube. (Actually, there's inhaled insulin now, but that's a whole other minor footnote.) Monoclonal antibodies are a newer group of drugs which are protein, and also given by needle. ",7,askscience,74% ,Tue Sep 5 22:32:03 2017 UTC,7,timepiggy,147,1214
There have been a dozen or so species in genus Homo; why did all but one sub-species disappear?,There may still have been H. erectus in Java when H. sapiens sapiens were building pyramids in Egypt.  Where is everybody? ,"You've asked a good question, and the only real answer is that archaeologists and paleoanthropologists simply do not have enough data to fully support any hypotheses on the extinctions of pre-modern Homo species.  Among the hypotheses that have been promoted are, of course, intraspecies violence, miscegenation, being out-competed by modern humans, and simply dying off due to failure to adapt to changing environmental conditions. To my knowledge, no evidence exists of any intraspecies Homo violence, though this does not mean it did not occur. Miscegenation, or interbreeding between different species and groups, certainly did happen between modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans.  We don't know exactly to what extent, but likely not on the level of integrated cultures on a large scale.  Enough, though, that most modern humans contain detectable quantities of Neanderthal and Denisovan genetic material.  I believe Papua New Guineans have the most ""non-modern"" DNA at something like 7% Denisovan. Competition between prehistoric humans and modern humans would need evidence of coexistence, which is rare.  The times at which various ancient populations existed can be hard to define, and being out-competed would require coexistence for some length of time.  As dates of late Neanderthal remains are refined, and new sites are discovered, more evidence should come to light. It is, in my opinion, most likely that changing environmental conditions put pressure on prehistoric human species, and gradually reduced their genetic integrity and geographic diversity.  It seems likely to me, though this is conjecture, that the arrival of modern humans did play a role in preventing a recovery of Neanderthal populations in Europe, though this assumes a lot in terms of time and relative population size. All in all, we can't answer that question.  We can come closest by looking at potential interactions between modern humans and prehistoric humans like Neanderthals, which included interbreeding, tool technology sharing, and possible cultural behavior transmission.  As for more ancient interactions, say between H. ergaster and H. habilis, there's practically no data available. As a last note, I don't know of any evidence suggesting H. erectus was alive in historic times.  The remnant species H. floresiensis, the Indonesian ""hobbit"", was at one point thought to have survived to the end of the Pleistocene, or even later, but last I heard that date had been pushed back to something like 50 kya.

What exactly is a laser composed of and what are the differences between different types of lasers?,"I understand that lasers are light (focused?) and that's about it. Lasers fascinate me. You can buy a pointer at pretty much any corner shop and those are very fun to play with. What interests me more are those lasers that cause damage. The ones that cut through metal and can disintegrate fabric/paper. What is the difference between a basic laser pointer and a laser capable of cutting through six inches of metal like a knife through butter? Is it simply the intensity of the light? And if that's the case, through what means do we control the intensity? I apologise if this question seems overly basic but, generally speaking, I am not a man of science. Thank you in advance for your answers and I look forward to being educated further on the topic. ","A laser is a source of highly monochromatic (one wavelength) and coherent light, which means that all the peaks and troughs in the emitted wave match up perfectly. They’re basically tools for creating really well controlled streams of light. Lasers broadly can be categorised into two types - pulsed and continuous beam. It’s the power output (amount of energy per second) of the laser that determines whether or not it can cut through things, typical laser pointers that you can pick up from a shop will be around 1 mW.  The colour of the laser is determined by a thing called the gain medium; if the medium is a mixture of helium and neon then the laser will be red, and if the medium is neodymium yttrium-aluminium-garnet, then the laser will be green (after a process called frequency doubling). You can effectively combine lasers together using a process known as laser pumping, which combines properties of laser outputs to generate the sort of light you require.  The most powerful lasers are typically pulsed, and they emit a very high amount of energy in a very short amount of time.  ",15,askscience,72% ,Tue Sep 5 09:29:35 2017 UTC,12,ChosenNeravarrine,14,0
What was weather like during the ice age?,"Nowadays, we have lots of interesting weather, like thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, snowfall, droughts, etc. How does ice age weather compare? ","Just a brief word or two about the term ice age. The Earth is currently in an Ice Age, known as the Quaternary or Pleistocene glaciation, which began 2.6 million years ago An ice age is a period of long-term reduction temperature of Earth's average global surface and atmospheric temperatures, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers.    Within a long-term ice age, the long stretches of time with cold climate are termed ""glacial periods"".  However, the long term cold is intermittently interrupted by relatively brief warmer periods called ""interglacials"".    What is commonly referred to as ""The Ice Age"" was merely the glacial period that ended when the current interglacial period began about 10000 years ago.  At some point this interglacial will give way to the next glacial period.  (Prior interglacials have lasted 10000-40000 years).  So I'll change your question to ""What is the weather like during the glacial periods of this ice age?"" I don't know how each individual weather phenomena will fare when the cold takes hold.  But in general, we can expect it to be drier, dusty (less precipitation & dropping sea level exposes ocean floor sediments), windy near the advancing ice shelves, and COLD, like our hunter/gatherer ancestors survived, but like modern human civilization has never experienced on a large scale (temperatures lower by up to 10°C (18°F) from their interglacial (i.e. current) norm in some regions).

Are we aware of correlations between photons/light/massless particles and causality that would hint at why light travels at c rather than some slower speed (or a converse; see question text)?,"Sorry if the title is misleading or confusing. I guess the tl;dr here is ""what's so special about light that it happens to travel at the speed of causality?"" Is there some intrinsic relationship between photons/particles lacking mass and causality/information? Or is this just one of those ""That's how the Universe works; we don't [yet] know why, or even if there is a particular reason"" ? Could also be a sort of chicken vs. egg question; please read on with my apologies for failing to express these thoughts concisely. From what I understand, c (~3 x 108 m/s) is the speed of causality, or of information. So, if parties A and B are spacelike-separated by some distance D meters, and an event X occurs in the immediate vicinity of party A, party B cannot be aware of that event until (at the earliest) D / c seconds later. So if party B is ~9 x 108 meters from party A, party B cannot possibly know that the event X has occurred until at least 3 seconds has passed (let's say parties A and B are in the same inertial frame to avoid relativistic effects for now). Fine; I can accept that as a physical rule of our Universe. There is some finite maximum speed at which information can propagate. What I don't understand is why light / massless particles are so fundamentally related to causality so as to have an identical propagation speed. Is it because information can be conveyed by almost any conceivable means, so if information about an event happens to be carried by massless particles, and massless particles travel at a particular maximum speed, which happens to be the highest speed we've ever observed, we conclude that causality travels at the same speed? If THAT preceding paragraph is true, then how do we prove that causality cannot propagate faster than c and we simply remain unaware of any means by which to test/falsify that hypothesis, since the fastest way we know to verify the propagation of causality is via (generally) EM radiation/photons? Is this just a really extended question about the proof of the relativity of simultaneity and I'm just going about thinking about it in an extremely convoluted, flawed fashion? I am aware of the scenarios postulated showing that traveling faster than light would effectively result in traveling backwards in time, causing a paradox, but don't they all hinge upon the assumption that the speed of light IS the speed of causality, rather than the possibility that the speed of light is slower than the speed of causality? I feel like I'm missing something relatively simple making this a sort of dumb question. Maybe a better tl;dr: What is the proof that the speed of light in a vacuum is exactly equal to the speed of causality, instead of the speed of light in a vacuum potentially being slower than that of causality, even if we are unaware of any phenomena traveling faster than light (or even if no such phenomena other than causality itself exist)? ","The answer is that the mathematics of relativity force particles with mass to move at less than c, and also force particles without mass to always move at c. The mathematical framework is just such that those are both true statements. I'm not sure if there's a better explanation than that.

Did the Big Bang originate from a Vacuum Decay?,"From what i understand, the Higgs Boson stays in a false vacuum, that if disturbed in any way, can result into a Vacuum Decay, growing at the speed of light and obliterating anything on it's way. Inside this bubble of destruction, lies entirely new laws of physics, changing how everything is.  Could the Big Bang be a Vacuum Decay that originated in another universe before it, meaning that beyond the expansion of the universe, is an entirely different universe made up by weird laws of physics? ","The current standard model predicts that, given the measured mass of the Higgs, it is in a metastable state for our universe. Metastable means that although there might be some lower vacuum, it is separated from our by a huge barrier and so the probability for tunneling is tiny.

Also many people think this metastability is a sickness of the theory because it is solved in extensions of the standard model. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum You're referring to the idea of chaotic or eternal inflation (see also the great Wikipedia pages).  Stephen Hawking just had a paper out on this topic, although it's quite technical. Essentially they're trying to work out the details of what sort of eternally inflating universe could end up ""nucleating"" one like ours but it turns out to be hard to do, i.e. eternal inflation initially was more of a conjecture.

If so, is there a density constant for every black hole in the universe ? Sorry for multiple questions. ","Black holes don't really have a density. You can see this old answer of mine to the same question. The volume bounded by the event horizon of a black hole is observer-dependent, for one. To the faraway observer hovering at infinity, the volume is not even defined. The mass is also not really located anywhere, so it's not correct to say the black hole is some spherical object with a mass and a volume. The best you can really say is that the mass is somehow located on the horizon, which has an observer-independent area of 4piR2 with R = 2GM/c2. So the mass per unit area, if interpreted as a useful quantity, is observer-independent and scales like 1/M, where M is the mass of the black hole.

I know that combustion and stellar fusion are very different processes. But what would happen if a star made of oxygen collided with a star made of hydrogen?,"A recently discovered star is composed almost entirely of oxygen. If this star collided with a star made almost entirely of hydrogen, would combustion actually happen? While combustion was taking place, what percentage of the star's total energy output could it be? ","Stellar collisions are very rare, but they do happen on occasion. Perhaps contrary to your intuition, stars are generally significantly too hot to support any sort of chemical combustion, even in their outer atmospheres. Most of the gas, in either this oxygen-rich white dwarf or in any ordinary hydrogen-rich star, will probably be either atomic gas (not in any molecular arrangement) or ionized gas (stripped of some or all of their electrons.) A molecular reaction, such as a hydrogen-oxygen burning, would be very rare, and the product would be short-lived. Whenever it would happen, the product (water) would be quickly destroyed (either from strong collisions from other gas particles or from the absorption of intense radiation), which would in the process remove any energy added to the gas in creating it. In other words, no combustion would occur. However, because this oxygen-rich star is a white dwarf, a stellar collision would probably trigger a Type Ia supernova. This would dwarf any other processes in the system. Stellar collisions of any kind tend to be pretty violent events, even if they don't result in a supernova. A small, dense object like a white dwarf is liable to punch straight through a larger star, especially giants, whose envelopes are pretty low density in comparison. This would be pretty spectacular.

"In a flood situation, what walls are holding up the water?",,"Levees. We tend to associate the word 'levee' with a man-made ridge built along the banks of a river to attempt to prevent floods, but these are modeled after (and in some cases enhancements of) natural features. Natural levees form through multiple flood events on a river. Water within a river channel is transporting sediment and the ability to transport sediment is dictated by the flow speed of the water. When a river overflows it banks, it is 1) entering an area that is typically extremely flat (i.e. a floodplain) so there is virtually no gravitational force to move it and 2) is often disconnected from the rest of the flow so there is no other water to 'push' it. This results in a rapid reduction in flow speed, meaning that the ability for the water to carry sediment is virtually nil once it overtop its banks, so the sediment that is suspended in that flow drops out and begins to form a deposit near the banks of the rivers. If this happens multiple times (over multiple flood events) this deposit will increase in size and begin to form a levee. ",2,askscience,100% ,Tue Sep 5 01:56:40 2017 UTC,2,j_B00G,501,7620

How soon after an organism 'dies' are all of its cells dead? its bacteria?,"Let's say an organism dies instantaneously (no previous oxygen deprivation). How long would the cells continue to be alive despite the macro organism being considered dead? How long would the bacteria within and on the body last? How much of a time difference would it be, if any, between say an ant and a blue whale? ","There is a problem with your question - ""die's instantaneously"" isn't the right way to word things, since dying is a process and a spectrum. What is death, and when is the ""macro-organism"" considered dead? Both very good questions, without simple answers. A simpler definition would define death as the loss body's ability to maintain the biologic functions necessary for life - a poor definition IMO, since it argues that death is the absence of life. Before modern medicine, death was the lack of breathing and a heartbeat/pulse. However, with CPR, electrical defibrillation, and medications, we are able to continue oxygenation of the organs, and potentially return a stable heart rhythm. This definition is no longer valid in the modern era. The modern medical definition separates death into brain death and cardiopulmonary death (the heart and lungs). Death of an organ is defined as ""irreversible damage causing the cessation of function of that organ"". Death of other organs is possible, but can be (at least partly) medically managed, or does not lead to the immediate cessation of functioning of the organism - e.g. one can live without renal function on dialysis, and complete loss of function of the liver would be a slow ""death"". So instead, let's frame the question differently - how long after the complete interruption of oxygenation do different organs and cells survive?  The most sensitive organ in the body is the brain. A general estimate is that the brain can survive for up to 10 minutes without oxygen, before there is widespread irreversible damage. This timing can be affected by many different factors - e.g. a low body temperature (hypothermia) extends survival, because it decreases the oxygen demands of the tissues. When dealing with hypothermic patients, ""you're not dead 'til you're warm and dead"". Back to the brain, giving a range for hypoxic time until brain death would be safer - I've seen sources give as little as 3 minutes; 10 minutes, as above, seems to be average; and longer is possible in certain scenarios. But the cells of the brain do not die evenly. Neurons (the ""most important"" brain cell) are the most sensitive to hypoxia, while other cells of the brain can survive longer. Neurons of one specific area (CA1 of the hippocampus, Sommer's area) is most sensitive, and irreversible damage to these cells usually occurs after 3 minutes of hypoxia. During autopsy, looking at these cells can be a helpful clue that significant hypoxia occurred prior to death. For other organs and tissues, the time from hypoxia to organ death varies; kidney and liver will survive for about 20 minutes, skeletal muscle for an hour and a half, and skin may survive for a few days. The cornea (part of the eye) remains healthy enough for transplantation up to 18 hours after death. As for bacteria - it probably depends on the type of bacteria. It also depends greatly on the conditions where the body is left. In a warm, moist, oxygenated environment, some species of bacteria will not only survive, but will thrive and multiple - causing putrification of the corpse. These bacteria (or at least their offspring) will survive until the corpse is rotted away to a point were there is no food left for the bacteria. If it is too dry, the bacteria will die, and the body will become mummified. If the body is embalmed, the embalming solution will kill the bacteria. TL:DR Death is a complicated concept, and is better thought of as a process, rather than a single event. There are different definitions of death, but modern medicolegal definitions define cardiopulmonary death and brain death separately. Different organs can survive for different amounts of time without oxygen - the brain is the most sensitive organ to hypoxia.

Why does clipping a sine wave create a square wave?,"I understand why an infinite series of odd harmonics at proportional amplitudes and frequencies creates a square wave, and I understand the additive properties of waves. I also understand why overdriving a sine wave through an amplifier/circuit cuts off the top and bottom of the wave, giving it a ""square"" appearance. I guess I don't understand the reasoning the other way around. How and why does the fairly simple operation of clipping turn one sine wave into an infinite series of sine waves? It may seem like I'm asking a question I've already answered, but that's not my intention, or maybe I'm not getting something. Let's say you didn't offhand know the harmonics of a square wave. How could you derive them from the shape of a square wave? Odd harmonics generate square/triangle waves. Why do square/triangle waves generate odd harmonics? Does that make sense, or is the answer just, ""dumb dumb, what about the transitive property don't you understand?"" ","It ends up being like you said a sort of transitive property because you're dealing with Fourier analysis. The Fourier analysis is basically working off the theorem saying you're working on a continuous, periodic function and it can be expressed in terms of the sum of its component sin/cos terms with phase and amplitude coefficients. When you go through an analysis on a square wave you'll come back with those odd component frequency components. And part of it being a Fourier series is that you can go back and forth between frequency space and time space as the two are fully inclusive. If you know the component sinusoids of a periodic continuous function you know the function. If you know the function you can run it through a spectrum analyzer (like your music visualizer) and analyze the frequency component's amplitudes and phases. The math of why it is only the odd components comes down to how you integrate the square wave function when doing the Fourier series component calculations and I believe you end up with something like a (cos(k*pi) -1) where k is the harmonic and so all the even harmonic wind up with ((1)-1 = 0). A cool way to see it is finding a music program and getting a sine vs a square wave going. You can try using the amplitude ratios and set the frequency. I did it before as a demo in a music theory class with I think 12 sine waves. Also can model in pspice or matlab if you're engineering type and see both way what's happening.

What are some other mathematical axioms/systems?,"To my understanding, in every system, axioms of what ""is"" and ""isn't"" must be defined and accepted.  In our current system of mathematics, for example, we know that 1 has the same identity as that of 1. We accept the value of 1, and of how it relates to other such values. From there on we branch out into complex number theory and the whatnot. For instance, very rudimentarily explained, Euclidean geometry differs from non-Euclidean geometry in the nature of parallel lines. Obviously the system of math that we use today won out over all others -- passed down century upon century from the first Egyptian etch or the prehistoric Chinese value system -- but what other mathematical axiomatic systems were/are made before the ""math"" that we know today? ","What you have defined are not really what the axioms of math are. There is no universal standard for mathematical axioms. Depending on what you do, you could decide to go with one or another, and there are different consequences for both. This goes deeper than just whether or not you have Euclidean or non-Euclidean geometry, though this is a very light example of some of how things can be different. There are also many different ""levels"" at which mathematicians work. At the high level, we just assume that we are working in some framework where everything makes sense. At this level, we might have things like ""Euclidean Geometry Axioms"" or ""Group Theory Axioms"" or ""Topological Space Axioms"", but these generally refer to different kinds of objects that we can create within our chosen mathematical framework. They aren't fundamental axioms, and function more like definitions/labels for things that implicitly depend on our higher axioms to make. Then there is the low-level stuff. The ""Assembly"" of math. These are axioms based on first principles (assuming some kind of formal logic) that create the framework that most working mathematicians assume exist. These are the axioms that we choose to define things like Set Theory, Category Theory or even something more exotic. These are very sensitive to what axioms you choose and how you decide to write them. Even within set theory, there are many different choices.  It is definitely not the framework handed down from the Egyptians or Greeks, and it took a lot of work in the last 150 years to figure out what the hell axioms are and how they fit together to form a mathematical framework. Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, Indians, etc all found the kinds of objects that we would like to have axioms be able to describe, but they gave us next to nothing for anything foundational about math (vague philosophical murmurs at best, and one example of a high-level axiomatic system). If you want to look for ""exotic"" types of math, then the past is not where you should look. It's the present. The math of the past was limited to basic counting and geometry, and while deep for the time, there was nothing anywhere near as exotic as what is around today. The many types of Set Theory: ZF, ZFC, ZF+CH, NBG, TG. Topos Theory. Even Formal Logic, nonstandard analysis and Universal Algebra are, in their own way, tangentally related to these ideas.

Do black holes show any promise in the hunt for dark matter/energy?,"Wouldn't we have a greater chance of finding an example of dark matter/energy near a black hole? If they suck in everything including light, wouldn't they suck in dark matter/energy, therefor resulting in more dark matter near the black hole? ","Black holes don't really ""suck"", they have the same force of gravity that everything else does. The main difference is that black holes are denser so you can get closer to the center without diluting the mass. If we replaced the sun with a black hole of the same mass, the Earth's orbit wouldn't change a bit. As you move towards the black hole sun, it remains the same as the old sun until you get to where the surface of the sun used to be. The Sun has a radius of 700,000 km, so if you are 400,000 km from the center, you've now got quite a bit of matter above you, so the gravitational pull is less than it would be if all the matter were still below you at the same radius. With a denser object of the same mass, all the mass is still below you, pulling you down. At the center of an object like the Sun or the Earth, the gravitational force pulling on you is zero (though the pressure from all of the stuff above you being pulled on is incredible). A black hole, though lets the parabolic increase in acceleration due to gravity with diminishing radius continue to much smaller radii. For a little while, people thought maybe dark matter was black holes. They called them ""Massive Compact Halo Objects"", or ""MaCHOs"" for short. In the late 80s, people set up projects to look for gravitational lensing around these black holes, which, if they existed, should be numerous. They pretty quickly proved that there was no secret population of black holes in the galactic halo responsible for dark matter, though. Now, the favorite candidate for dark matter is Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or ""WIMPS"" - you know, instead of ""MaCHOs"". Particle physicists at Fermi Lab and CERN are looking for these in their colliders, but haven't found any dark matter candidate particles yet.

"With regards to the Diving Reflex, can we hold our breath longer while underwater than we can on land?",,"So the Diving Reflex is the idea that when our bodies are submerged in cold water, the body stops some not as important physiological processes, for example digestion. WHat actually happens is the blood vessels supplying oxygenated blood to the stomach are constricted, thus not allowing as much (or in some cases any) blood to reach the stomach. Cells need oxygen to function (cellular respiration), and without it, the cells won't do their jobs.  So, certain parts of the body are no longer receiving oxygenated blood. There was no blood loss, so the unused oxygenated blood must be going somewhere. It stays in the bloodstream and delivers it's oxygen to the important sites, for example the brain. Now there's less oxygenated blood being ""wasted"" on non-essential processes, therefore there is less oxygen being wasted. Deoxygenated blood becomes oxygenated again in the alveoli of the respiratory system. The oxygen it uses comes from the air we breath in, so the reserved air you have (your breath) can stretch longer.  Assuming you're on land and not in extreme cold, your body doesn't do this. So, on land you continue to supply oxygen to non-essential functions (Assuming you're not in some other dire situation). On land, your stored reserve of oxygen (your breath) is used up faster.

"Why do nuclear explosions in the atmosphere cause little radioactive fallout, while explosions close to ground level cause massive amounts of radioactive fallout?",,"They both cause the exact same amount of fallout, but it gets distributed differently and at different time scales.  A surface or near-surface burst, where the fireball either is in contact with the ground or sucks up a lot of debris into it, has lots of relatively large dirt particles mixed into it. ""Relatively large"" here means the size of a snowflake or so. The radioactive fission products (the remaining ""halves"" of those atoms that are split) attach themselves to the dirt. This makes them much heavier, and a lot of them ""fall out"" of the cloud within a few hours. That means that you get a relatively local (hundreds of miles) plume of radioactive contamination within a day or so of the blast. This means the particles are still very ""hot"" from a radioactive standpoint. So that creates a real health hazard: high concentrations of highly radioactive particles in a limited (but large) area. This is known as ""local fallout"" because of its relatively local area (i.e. ""just"" downwind of the mushroom cloud, but that can still be many thousands of square miles affected for large weapons).  In an airburst, the dirt isn't mixed in, so those particles remain ""light"" and hot. They stay in the upper atmosphere longer. They still eventually ""fall out"" of the cloud, but it's over a much large physical area — like the size of a continent or even hemisphere — and usually weeks later. That means two things: 1. the concentration on the ground at any given place is not very high, so it only adds a bit to the background rate of radioactivity, and 2. by staying up in the clouds for so long, only relatively longer-lived fission products still remain when it falls down (e.g. things with longer half-lives) so the overall radioactivity is less. This is called ""global fallout,"" and it more or less raises the background level of radioactivity globally (though some areas can get a bit more than others depending on how the winds circulate) by a small amount. Where the ""local fallout"" of the ground burst is a ""kill you or hurt you in a short amount of time"" sort of level of radioactivity, ""global fallout"" is a ""adds to your overall radioactivity exposure in a small amount"" sort of hazard. Over very large populations (e.g. the entire world) this adds up to an up-tick in fatal cancers contracted over decades, but the up-tick is small enough that it is very hard to isolate from other carcinogens (even though it still might be what you might consider a large ""raw number"" of cancers — e.g. some tens or hundreds of thousands of excess cancers from atmospheric nuclear testing in the Cold War, which is a lot of people but a very small number compared to the number of people who got cancer from other sources over that time period).  So, to recap, both release the same amount of fallout. But in surface bursts, it comes down fast, concentrated, and ""hot."" For higher altitude bursts, it generally (with some exceptions, e.g. if it rains immediately afterwards) comes down slowly, diffusely, and less radioactive (because of the ""slowly"" part).

Whatever experimental setup you use, the more precisely you try to measure the momentum, the less precisely you can measure the position. However, you can know both of them to within a certain margin of error at the same time. Therefore, you can predict where the particle will be a short time later, but not precisely. There will always be a margin of error in the predicted position, and no matter how you try to improve your experiment, you'll never be able to get that below a certain value.

"Need help Understanding JFET's, Specifically how the depletion region is controlled and its relationship to drain current?","So we just started studying FET's in my Electronics circuits and device theory class, I have a basic understanding of how N-channel JFET's work. I am having trouble wrapping my head around how the depletion region is affected by VDS/Drain current when VGS is set to 0V. I think the larger the drain current(ID) becomes the more free electrons are ""pulled""(not sure if correct term) from the N-type making the depletion region have more positive ions. I am trying to understand what is physically happening in the depletion region when VGS=0 and ID increases. I also want to understand the other side, Where ID is a function of VGS, How does applying a larger negative voltage make the depletion region larger and how does that effect the resistance of the N-channel. What is the difference between the depletion region when VGS=0 and ID is at saturation compared with VGS= Some negative value and ID = some lower saturation current. What physically happens to the charges in the depletion region? I can clarify if what I'm asking is unclear. ","Let's start with fundamental materials first. N-type material is doped with pentavalent elements and P-type is doped with trivalent elements.  An n-type jfet has an excess of electrons in it's source to drain conducting channel due to N-type doping, and an excess of holes on the gate due to P-type doping. Therefore, when N-type and P-type are placed together to form a junction, electrons migrate into the P-side and holes migrate into the N-side. Diffusion of an electron from the N-side to the P-side leaves a positive ion behind on the N-side, and diffusion of a hole leaves a negative ion on the P-side. This creates an electric field that provides a force opposing the continued exchange of charge carriers.  The formation and change in width of the depletion region depends on the voltage applied to the gate and voltage applied to the source(see construction of a n-type JFET). If you have a lower voltage applied to the gate relative to the voltage applied to the source ie a negative gate to source voltage, the PN junction is reverse biased, causing current flow from source to gate, creating more negative ions and more positive ions in their respective channels and an increase in width of the depletion region. As Vgs becomes more negative, the n-type material is depleted of electrons(more positive ions) resulting in greater resistance to current flow(from source to drain) and a smaller drain current.

What determines the boiling and freezing points of a substance?,,"Long story short (in case someone else can't give a more technical response) is that every single molecule is attracted to other molecules of its kind in a pure solution of it. That being said, some molecules are really good at attracting each other (things that are solid at room temperature) and other things aren't as good at it (gases at room temperature). Normally, this ability to attract other molecules depends on uneven charges molecules. Think of them as really tiny magnets almost because there are more electrons in one part of the molecule than in other parts. Elements like Oxygen, Fluorine, and other halogens are really good at pulling electrons in, but other elements like Hydrogen and Carbon aren't so good. This is called the electronegativity of an atom. In any event, the slightly positive part of a molecule will line up with the slightly negative part of a different molecule. It's not a full bond because electrons aren't being shared, but it's evough of an attraction to make a noticeable enough difference, especially when there's just SO MANY molecules in a test tube normally (on the order of 1023 for 18 g of water). If there are no slightly charged areas, like in methane which is a carbon surrounded by 4 hydrogens, then molecules have a hard time attracting each other. This is why methane is a gas at a LOT of temperatures. The physical temperatures required the change states are pretty unimportant, they are really just a result of a molecule having greater or weaker attractions to other molecules.

Furthermore, any decent speakers at least split the hi from the mid/bass so different specific drivers handle a narrower band that they are best suited to reproducing and only that frequency band is sent to that driver via a crossover. Usually, The better speakers split that further so that dedicated driver whether it be the Tweeter/Horn (hi) mid driver (mid)  and bass driver only has to handle that band.

Melting on the other hand is where the molecules in a substance start shaking so violently that they lose structure, like a building collapsing due to a hurricane.

When you divide two things that have units, the result is a number followed by the phrase '[unit type 1] per [unit type 2]'. For example, speed is measured by taking the distance you travel and dividing it by the time it takes to go that far. If you go 120 metres in 10 seconds, you calculate: 120 metres ---------- 10 seconds  in order to get: 12 metres    ------  1 second  though convention means we can just omit the '1' and assume everybody knows that's how many seconds we're talking about. The shorthand is therefore 12 metres per second or 12 m/s. 'Per' essentially means 'divided by' or 'divided between'. Take-home message: the way the units are written tells you something about what was multiplied or divided to arrive at that result.  With mAh (or Ah), you're seeing the result of exactly the same logic except it's the result of a multiplication instead of division. When you multiply, the numbers and their units all stay on the same (top) line of the calculation: 2 Amperes x 4 hours = 8 Ampere hours (or Ah) (Note: since 1 Ampere = 1000 milliamperes, this is the same as 8000 mAh.) This means you could draw 8 Amps for a period of 1 hour before the battery was drained. Alternatively, you could draw 1 Amp for 8 hours, or 2 Amps for 4 hours, or 0.5 Amps for 16 hours, etc. Voltage = current x resistance (V=IR), so voltage depends on the current drawn by the device attached to the battery as well as the resistance of its circuits. Maybe a physicist can tell us more about whether / how that curve drops off as a battery approaches depletion. ",2,askscience,62% ,Fri Sep 1 20:00:15 2017 UTC,8,Avijit97,152,-5

"If you could detect and measure Hawking radiation, could you tell what was inside of the black hole?",,"If information is to be conserved (a principle known as unitarity) then the information brought in that everything that fell in, and then stored in the black hole, must then be all contained in the total Hawking radiation emitted by the BH in its whole lifetime, after it's evaporated completely. If you had perfect, microscopic knowledge of the quantum state of the total Hawking radiation (and of the fundamental laws of the Universe, including quantum gravity) you'd be able to reconstruct the original state of the matter that fell into the black hole. However, this information is stored in the Hawking radiation not in some straightforward way as a certain number of bits per amount of radiated particles; the radiation is instead strongly entangled with itself and the information lies there. In practice, this means that even omitting a small part of the radiation makes most of the information unreadable. There's a more famous example of how this works: I'm Alice and I have a message to you, Bob. I write my arbitrarily long message in a piece of paper and throw it in a black hole. You try to decode the message from the Hawking radiation that comes out. It turns out you need to wait for half the whole BH (in horizon area) to evaporate before you can even decode one single bit from my message. This is because when the BH is partially evaporated, the information of the message is in great part encoded in entanglement between the Hawking radiation particles and the remaining portion of the black hole itself. (This cryptographic property of BH is very important in that it solves a very tricky problems with the holographic principle, known as the xeroxing paradox). In any case, all of this assumes you can acquire perfect microscopic knowledge of the state of Hawking radiation. In reality, you are a macroscopic observer unable to perform anything else but a few macroscopic measurements. In this sense the information in Hawking radiation is completely unreadable and it looks like a zero-information state from a macro perspective - equivalently, it has maximum entropy. That's why it's in thermal equilibrium. From this macro POV then BHs are ideal shredders, completely erasing useful information. Of course what really happens is that the info is not getting destroyed, but just getting very scrambled to the point of being macroscopically unretrievable.

Blindness vs Solar Eclipse?,"With the recent solar eclipse and the many people who decided it would be fun to view without protection, many of these people took the risk of damaging their eyes to a certain extent. Question:  If someone who is already blind decided to stare at the eclipse, would they suffer any permanent eye damage like someone who has the ability to see or would it be a meager injury such as irritation of the eyes? ","Blindness can happen when any of several different stages of signal capture in the eye and transmission to the brain are interrupted. If the blindness comes from a problem after light hits retina, the sun's light will have the same harmful effect on the cells it hits. If someone is at some stage of legal blindness (i.e. not total, absolute nothingness) as a result of some occlusion in the front part of the eye (like heavy, untreated cataracts) then there's going to be less sunlight entering. I don't know whether anyone has quantified how much less*, but I'd imagine it's still going to be over the threshold of damage.  Very difficult to measure.

How does low mass close binary star systems change over time and what is their ultimate fate?,"For example, what will happen in the future in a system like Kepler-47? ","Kepler-47 is a G6V/M4V binary with an orbital period of 7.45 days. That's close enough together (~18 solar radii) that when the G star evolves onto the giant branch and expands, it will overfill the gravitational equipotential surface in the co-rotating reference frame called the ""Roche-Lobe"", which is just a mathematical way of expressing when material is more attracted to the other star than it's original host star. The result is that material starts to fall off of the G6 star (now a giant) and onto the red dwarf.  Now when this mass transfer happens, it changes the distribution of mass in the system, which changes the Roche geometry and moves the center of mass of the system. The angular momentum of the system is ALSO redistributed, so the stars will move closer together since the transferring star is more massive than its companion. The stars moving closer together moves MORE material past the equilibrium point (L1), which moves the stars closer together, which moves MORE material past L1, etc, so the mass transfer is unstable.  At this point, a number of different things can happen, and predicting what exactly it will be for a given system is pretty hard.   In some systems, like Algol, the mass transfer shuts off once the mass ratio flips and the previous red dwarf now has the mass (and temperature and luminosity!) of a more massive star and the old more massive star is the lighter of the two.  This is the most interesting one (to me). Some systems will enter a common envelope with a shared atmosphere and remain in that state until they either merge or the cores spiral towards each other but their energy and angular momentum ejects the common envelope before the merge, leaving what looks like a main sequence red dwarf again orbiting a hydrogen-deficient core which can continue to evolve in a weird way, but at this mass ends up ultimately as a white dwarf. Eventually, the orbit will continue to decay (via magnetic braking or gravitational radiation, depending on the mass of the donor now - but a M4V star would be by magnetic braking) and the system gets into Roche Lobe contact again, this time with the red dwarf filling its Roche Lobe. Now, it's the less-massive object donating mass and the transfer can be stable (as long as M2/M1 < ~5/6, otherwise the star doesn't shrink as fast as the Roche geometry does when a bit of matter moves across). The falling material forms an accretion disk which serves to transfer angular momentum away from the infalling material and allows some of it to fall on the surface of the white dwarf.  This type of system is called a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) because sometimes enough material builds up on the white dwarf to have a classical nova eruption, but they can do lots of other stuff too and it's a very complex zoo. They can have Dwarf Novae (which are instabilities in the accretion disk, and there are several kinds of those systems), or can be in a persistently ""high"" accretion state called a nova-like, or they can be in a middle state and switch between having dwarf nova and being a nova-like (like Z Cam). If it's a white dwarf with a particularly strong magnetic field, it can channel material straight to the poles of the white dwarf from L1 or the accretion disk (Polars and Intermediate Polars, depending on if the white dwarf has tidally locked to the orbital period or not). Some CVs have been seen to go from one of these states to the other, which has led to some proposing that Classical Novae can knock the system out of equilibrium and drive accretion rates up until they settle down again, but that's still pretty speculative and not widely accepted. Anyway, where was I? Oh right, also... They can merge together. This is a rapid event and so is rare, but V1309 Sco was seen to do this in 2011. V1309 Sco was a contact binary before this happened, but instead of ejecting the common envelope the cores just merged together. They noticed a transient in the sky and went back and looked at it in archival survey data, and noticed that it was a binary star. They could even track the orbital period shrinking as it wound down. It's a pretty spectacular result.   I can't tell you exactly which of these Kepler-47 will do in 5 billion years, but it should be fun for whoever is around and not on a planet orbiting them.  EDIT: If you start with massive stars instead of a G star, the massive core can go core-collapse supernova after the common envelope phase and form a black hole or neutron star, which could unbind the binary or form a Low Mass X-ray Binary (LMXB). LMXBs can act a lot like CVs, having disk instabilities or being persistently bright and, for neutron star primaries, even equivalents of classical novae called X-ray bursts where hydrogen starts fusing on the surface and it all goes boom in a few seconds. LMXBs have lots of radiation coming out in X-rays, whereas CVs have it mostly come out in the UV (though they have X-ray emission too, just not as much as LMXBs do). LMXBs can be ~1 million times more luminous than the sun, but in X-rays instead of optical light, because the gravitational potential well for neutron stars and black holes is so deep.

How do scientists isolate these particles and how do they store them, and how do they manipulate these particles to ""fire"" them at a substance? Is the way these are fired the same as just atoms of an element? ","The way we do it now is a little different than how it was done in those old-fashioned experiments. For the Rutherford experiment, you just place an alpha source near a target (in some kind of vacuum chamber). But then you're limited to alpha particles, they only come out at the specific energies provided by your source, and they're emitted isotropically, so most of them probably don't even hit your target. We need to do better than this. In modern experiments we use particle accelerators. We can produce beams of many different species. We can accelerate them to a bunch of different energies. We can also optimize the properties of the beam (how large it is in space, how divergent it is in angles, how tight the momentum distribution is, etc.). We can steer and focus the charged particle beam using magnets and guide it onto our target much more precisely than simply placing an isotropic source near it. The particles in the (stable*) beam originate in an ion source. In a simplified picture, you just take chemically stable atoms of the desired species and heat them up to ""boil off"" some or all of their electrons (there are also sputtering sources which add additional electrons to the atom, or ECR sources, and others). Once the electrons are gone, what you've got left is a charged nucleus, which can be accelerating using electric fields. You can then guide your ions (could be hundreds, or thousands, or millions per second, maybe more depending on the machines) into an accelerator to speed them up to the desired energy. Once the beam is at the energy you want, you steer it around and keep it focused using magnets. Magnets don't change the energy of the particles. (* Producing a beam of radioactive species is more challenging, but I can go into the details on that too.) Finally your beam interacts with a target, or another beam in the case of colliders. This is where the experimentally interesting scattering and reactions occur, and some of the outgoing particles end up in your detectors to be measured.

Why does the standard deviation formula have an (n-1) instead of n?,"The formula to calculate standard deviation involves adding the squares of differences between the point and mean for each data point, then dividing it by (n-1). Since standard deviation is a way to calculate spread that corresponds with mean, why isn't the sum divided by n? ","Essentially, you want to try and find the population standard deviation from a smaller sample. If the population is finite and you know all the relevant information (eg, you know everyone's age in the US), then you can compute the exact population standard deviation, and this has an 'N' in the bottom rather than 'N-1'. But this works because if we know absolutely everything about a population, then we can compute the actual mean of the population. If we only have a sample of the population, then the mean itself is an estimation. So every time you use the mean of the sample, you're introducing error. In fact, using the sample mean and dividing by 'N', you will always underestimate the actual standard deviation you would get if you knew and computed with the actual mean. Wikipedia has a pretty good explanation of why this happens. So computing the standard deviation using the sample mean (and dividing by N) will always give you a smaller standard deviation than you should get. Luckily, we can compare this computed standard deviation to the standard deviation you would get using the population mean instead, and the way to correct for the error that you get for using the sample mean is to multiply your result by N/(N-1), which is the same as just dividing by N-1 at the get-go.

How many generations does it takes before medical history becomes irrelevant?,,"In theory, infinitely many. Consider for example a man that lived, say 30,000 years ago that had some recessive genetic disorder. He could pass this gene on for 1000 generations, and assuming no one else in the tree carried that gene, none of his descendents would developed this disease. Until after 1000 generations, a distant descendent of his has a child with a woman that also carries this gene and their child has a genetic disease.  There is no length of time where genetics or medical history becomes irrelevant. That said, the further back it goes the less influence it has. First of course, because with more generations you have more ancestors, and it is less likely you would have inherited a gene from any one ancestor. And second, because it becomes increasingly unlikely that a disease that was present in your family 30,000 years ago would not have been present in any of the 1000 generations before you.

"Do our skin cells, or liver cells, contain the genetic data for EVERYTHING in our bodies?","Do the DNA residing in the cells that live in our eyes, have genetic data that codes for how our feet should develop in humans? ","While there are some exceptions, almost every kind of cell in your body have a complete set of 46 chromosomes (all of your nuclear DNA). Red blood cells don't contain nuclear DNA (but they have mitochondria, and mitochondria have their own DNA) or mitochondria (thanks for catching that, u/JeremyFredericWilson), and sperm cell and egg cells have only half a set of chromosomes (though egg cells only do this at the absolute last minute, thanks u/Rather_Dashing). Edit: Biology is complicated. Never forget that. ",13,askscience,89% ,Thu Aug 31 03:07:55 2017 UTC,17,habibitee,1671,3572
Shouldn't we be able to see black hole mergers via regular EM astronomy?,"When reading about the first detection of graviational waves, I saw this:  During the final 20 milliseconds of the merger, the power of the radiated gravitational waves peaked at about 3.6×1049 watts – 50 times greater than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the observable universe.  Shouldn't this show up in the sky as as a star blinking into existence (or a slow ramp, not sure about the steepness of the curve)?  If so, is there a way to match the EM observation with the GW observation?  I imagine you can draw an arc using the two detectors and retroactively cross-reference with high energy EM events. Why haven't I heard of any detections of mergers prior to GW astronomy? ",http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AAS...21914617D Yes we can. The issue is knowing where to point the telescopes. There is a small probability of finding a merger randomly in observations. This abstract describes using LIGO hits to direct observers to a merger. ,7,askscience,61% ,Wed Aug 30 14:57:20 2017 UTC,6,jammerjoint,32556,91434
