Do the radioactive elements in nuclear weapons emit detectable radiation?,"I am curious to know whether nuclear weapons emit detectable radiation at any stage of their lifecycle.  For the sake of argument, let's say we are considering a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb, but if someone feels like sharing any expertise on fission weapons too, great. Intuitively, I'd think that there would have to be a certain amount of radiation released during construction of these weapons just by passive decay of any uranium or plutonium involved in the construction...but what about after they are completed?  Do they emit radiation during transport, storage, and/or once in-flight towards a target?  How would such radiation be mitigated - lead-shielded transport containers, perhaps? Is there any hope of us ever developing some kind of ""early warning system"" to detect such radiation that would allow us to say, ""That missile/bomb/etc. that is on a ballistic trajectory is/is not armed with a nuclear warhead"" - ? Thank you in advance to anyone who cares to comment. "," I am curious to know whether nuclear weapons emit detectable radiation at any stage of their lifecycle. For the sake of argument, let's say we are considering a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb, but if someone feels like sharing any expertise on fission weapons too, great.  Thermonuclear weapons contain fission warheads in them as well as fuel for the fusion reactions. Any fissile material used for the fission part of the explosion is radioactive, and can be detected in principle.  Intuitively, I'd think that there would have to be a certain amount of radiation released during construction of these weapons just by passive decay of any uranium or plutonium involved in the construction...but what about after they are completed? Do they emit radiation during transport, storage, and/or once in-flight towards a target? How would such radiation be mitigated - lead-shielded transport containers, perhaps?  The nuclei inside the warhead don't care whether you're still assembling the bomb, transporting it, or storing it, they'll continue to decay all the same. You can always detect their radioactivity in principle, although the people with the bomb can shield it to try to mask its presence.  Is there any hope of us ever developing some kind of ""early warning system"" to detect such radiation that would allow us to say, ""That missile/bomb/etc. that is on a ballistic trajectory is/is not armed with a nuclear warhead"" - ?  To do something like that in-flight, I don't know. But we do have ways of looking for nuclear weapons at various stages of their lives. We can try to go to the root of it, where the fission fuel is first being enriched or diverted. We can monitor the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors to look for unexpected changes in the power of the reactor, which could signify that it's been shut down to add or remove material from the core which could end up being diverted for the purpose of making weapons. We can use neutron or gamma ray detectors to monitor for nuclear weapons tests, or RDDs (dirty bombs). Detecting and tracking down improper usage of radiological materials is obviously a very important task, and many people have thought very hard about how to do these things. There are lots of ways to monitor for these kinds of activities, and new ideas are constantly coming about within the nuclear nonproliferation/applied nuclear physics community.

"For a reaction with a given reaction mechanism, is the activation energy a constant?","I know that catalysts use a different reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy, but for a given mechanism, does the activation energy change with respect to temperature, pressure, or reactant concentration? ","In practice the energy required to overcome a barrier is the same for the same reaction path.  Most of the factors you named will change the entropy of the system, change the average kinetic energy, or change the reaction path entirely.  Those factors will have an impact on the rate of the reaction, however this affects the free energy and not the activation energy itself.

What is gravity like at the center of the Earth?,"So say you were able to reach the center of the Earth, what would gravity be like? Would there be a sense of getting pulled in a direction (down?), or would you be weightless like in space? ","The gravitational field at the exact center of Earth is 0. (Strictly speaking, this doesn't occur exactly at the center because of the nonuniformity of Earth, but any compact mass distribution has a point where the field is 0. So somewhere near/at the center, the field is 0.) So, assuming you were some magical being that could survive the heat and pressure and molten core and also move about without really interacting with anything other than via gravity, you would feel no net force at the center. (You would also feel weightness, but this is because weightlessness is a sensation we get when we don't feel the reaction force to gravity, e.g., the normal force from your chair or ground.) If you displace yourself a small distance from the center, you will feel pulled back toward the center, then overshoot it because of your non-zero speed, then move out to some maximum, come back to the center, and repeat. Your motion is similar to that of a pendulum or other simple harmonic oscillator. In fact, for an exactly uniform and spherical Earth, any object placed at rest anywhere inside Earth will experience SHO with period T = 2π√(Rearth3/(GMearth)), which is about 85 minutes.

"Since the surface of the Sun is only ~14 times hotter than my oven when I'm baking a pizza, why am I able to feel the Sun's heat from 93 million miles away?",,"For one, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that for a black body, the total power radiated per unit area scales with the fourth power of temperature. So the surface of the Sun may only be 14 times the absolute temperature, but the power radiated per unit time per unit area is multiplied by about 38,000. In fact, this law is what was used to first estimate the temperature of the Sun. Suppose we know a certain object at a known temperature has some heat energy flux. We can then also measure the heat energy flux from the Sun across a region with known area. Comparing the two and using the SB-law then gives an estimate for the temperature of the Sun. (Stefan originally made an estimate of about 5700 K, which is very close to the actual value of 5778 K.) Note that for this method you also need some estimate of how much energy is absorbed by the atmosphere since only the energy flux at the surface of Earth was feasibly measurably at the time.

What Does Sagittarius A* Look Like?,Suppose we were able to exist at a safe distance from Sagittarius A*.  Perhaps we are in Carl Sagan's Ship of the Imagination.  What would we see?  What about various distances?  Do the stars that orbit it move fast enough for us to see with the naked eye?  Is there visible matter surrounding it?  What would such a hole in space even look like?  How would it bend light and spaetime?  Etc... etc... etc... I am an author writing a story about a man who has visions of Sagittarius A* and I want his visions to be accurate despite the fact that he is insane. ,"Well - most things are really a matter of perspective, and it all depends on where you are when you're looking. The black hole itself isn't that far across, at least in cosmological terms. Estimates vary, but it might be as small as 24 million km across: on the range of a very large star, and within the orbit of Mercury. The star closest to the black hole does move very quickly: up to 1% of the speed of light at periapsis! But periapsis is still 40 billion km away. It takes 11 years to complete an orbit, even though it's so fast, so it'd still take 5.5 years to cross half the sky. Probably too slow to watch. However, there's some hope, because it's an elliptical orbit, and it's much faster as it gets in closer. Much better, but it'd still be almost three years per orbit, so too slow to watch. Most of the motion you see in the night sky is, after all, based on the Earth's rotation. Of course, there are probably many objects in much closer than that star, and they could be moving at all sorts of speeds. So a smaller object might look like something zipping through the sky, like a satellite. As far as those smaller objects go, though, we haven't been able to detect anything specific; it's below the resolution of our instruments.  But we do believe there to be a large cloud of gas and dust, superheated because of the black hole's pull. We're blocked from detecting this in visible light, but there's evidence it's extremely bright. So your observer might not be able to be too close, if he's still able to see at all.

Why Does Distilled Water Evaporating Slower Than Tap Water?,"Sorry if this has been asked before, I searched around didn't see anything but assumed this would've come up before. Anyways, so my wife uses distilled water to clean baby bottles and stuff like that in one of those steamers. Well she pointed out to me the other day that, when she sets the bottle down on the drying rack, the little droplets of distilled water don't evaporate very quickly.  They'll sit there for a few days without evaporating she said.  I didn't really believe her so we did an experiment where we had identical bottles. Both cleaned with distilled water in the steamer but we rinsed one with tap water, then set them both in the same position next to each other on the drying rack. By the evening, the tap-water-rinsed bottle was completely dry but the distilled only bottle was still covered with those droplets on the inside. What's going on here? ","It shouldn't. Dissolving salts into water raises the boiling point, or in other words it increases the amount of energy required to evaporate the liquid, since when evaporating you have to 'give back' the energy given off when the salt dissolved. (if it didn't give off energy the salt would be insoluble and then the boiling point wouldn't change - in other words, you can only raise the boiling point of water by adding impurities)  So salt water (and tap water) normally evaporates more slowly than salt-free distilled water. I'm a bit doubtful whether you had the exact same amount of water in both bottles. As for why the drying is slow in general, that's most likely because there isn't very good air circulation in the bottle. Once the air in the bottle is saturated with moisture, further evaporation can only occur once the air is replaced. A bottle of water with a long narrow neck will dry out slower than a drinking glass containing the same amount of water, and both will dry out slower than the same water in a wide, shallow pan.

"How accurate is it theoretically possible for weather forecasting to be? For example, with a powerful enough supercomputer, will we eventually be able to predict the exact track of a hurricane weeks in advance? Are there any other factors limiting prediction accuracy aside from computing power?",,"The practical limit of a weather forecasts is about 10 days, I believe the theoretical limit is around two weeks (sorry I can't find a reference, on mobile). The limit is because the weather is a chaotic system. Chaos in this context doesn't mean random, it has a specific meaning relating to the growth of tiny errors in the initial conditions of the forecast. Imagine you had two identical worlds (i.e. a perfect simulation) but in one a butterfly decided to fly in a different direction (I guess I'm assuming butterflies have free will!). The air flow in the two worlds will start to diverge, the tiny difference will grow and after about two weeks the weather patterns will look completely different.  There are other types of forecasts that extend beyond the current 10 day limit, for example I work on seasonal forecasting. But that requires a slow moving component of the climate system - e.g. an El Niño - that exerts a force on the weather that pushes it in a certain direction. Then we can't tell you if it will rain on January 12th, but we can predict a higher than average monthly temperature. Similar thing with climate forecasts, that's about calculating the forcing of the system to determine mean temperature changes. ",16,askscience,78% ,Mon Sep 18 20:28:32 2017 UTC,9,poozemusings,127,5,
What is the gold and silver foil they put on satellites and why is it important?,"I was looking at a picture of a satellite in the news the other day and noticed that every time I've seen some kind of space-related piece of equipment, it is wrapped in gold/silver foil.

"In physics, why is the formula to calculate force F=ma instead of F=mv (mass x velocity)?","For example, if a car that weighs 2 kilograms his traveling at a constant speed of 31 meters a second as the car hits you. It would give you a fair amount of force right?  But the formula states that since the car is not accelerating and is at a constant speed, a=0, since 2,000 x 0 = 0 the formula says that the car hits you with a force of 0 newtons (which I don't think is accurate) Even if the car started at 0 m/s and started to accelerate at 2m/s/s wouldn't the calculations still be wrong and have an incorrect amount of force calculated? ","The problem is that you are not calculating an impact force correctly. The equation F = ma tells you the net force on an object. But the equation does not tell you directly the impact force of one object on another when they crash. For instance, if an object of mass M traveling at speed V just before impact crashes into a rigid wall and comes to rest over a time period T, then Newton's second law tells you that the average impact force felt by the object was F = MV/T because its average acceleration was just V/T. So, indeed, the impact force increases with impact velocity, as expected. ",21,askscience,70% ,Tue Sep 19 04:47:58 2017 UTC,21,kool_kolumbine_kid,2193,348,
Could we railgun the Moon?,Is the reach of the US Navy railgun long enough to reach the Moon? ,"No. The US Navy railgun can accelerate projectiles to Mach 6. This is merely 2 km/s. You need 7.6 km/s to get into orbit and significantly more to reach the Moon (haven't done the math but it must be slightly less than 11.2 km/s which is escape speed). Even if we had a railgun powerful enough to reach orbital speed, at such great speeds and with the high density of air at sea level the projectile would burn up like a meteor and probably never leave the atmosphere. Some enthusiasts of the rail gun idea affirm that a heat shield could resist this effect and that launching fast enough could account for speed loss to air drag. Honestly I haven't found reputable sources confirming this or showing the math, and I seriously doubt it because of the very high air density at low altitudes. Spacecraft reentering the atmosphere usually burn up at altitudes between 80km and 120km. ",18,askscience,68% ,Tue Sep 19 08:59:49 2017 UTC,10,Borsippian,78,549,

What's the maximum theoretical limit for specific energy for a capacitor with known laws of physics? What formulas are used to determine the theoretical limits here? ","Sorry, I'm on mobule. With the bare laws of physics, the limit is given by  E/m = c2 = 90 billion MJ/kg And now you are going to say: ""That's not helpful!"" But it is. You see, take a spherical capacitor formula, C = constant x radius Now, capacitance grows with radius, so you can just take a thin spherical shell with little mass and make it big. Very big. As big as you want. So by a spherical capacitor, there is no limit besides E=mc2 and the one-atom thickness shell. But mass is proportional to R2, capacitance grows with R, electric field decreases with R2, and the maximum outward pressure the sphere supports decreases with R. So we can increase the voltage by R2 /R = R Energy is CV2, so maximum stored energy increases with R3, which is faster than mass. What does this teach us? That the question has a problem: It assumes that maximum stored energy only depends on mass, and that's not the case: volume is important too.

How do rainbows that curve away from the sun work?,"As I walked to work today I saw a iridescent cloud above, and it wasn't just that but a full rainbow (or two if you look closely enough).

How is online gaming possible if there must be some delay?,"Online communication always has a delay, especially when people communicating are on opposite sides of the US. If that's the case, then how are fast FPS video games, like Call of Duty, possible to play online?  ","Modern games tend to employ two different techniques simultaneously in order to compensate for lag, but players with lower latency will still have a small advantage.  Server state rewind: You're playing an FPS at home and you pull the trigger.  At that moment, the stuff you see on your screen is already out of date by 20-50ms.  And the command to fire your gun doesn't reach the server for another 20-50ms.  But the server knows when you fired the gun, so it just rewinds the game to that exact moment to find out what you hit. Client-side prediction: Certain actions that you perform in the game (firing, moving, jumping, whatever) don't actually execute until the server receives the command.  But the game would feel terribly sluggish if your client were to wait for official confirmation.  So your client simulates the command locally under the assumption that the server will allow the action.  You pull the trigger, and your client immediately plays a gunshot sound and draws tracer rounds on the screen.  You feel like it executed immediately... but other players in the game actually don't see your shot until 100ms later.  These techniques allow games to feel responsive and accurate, but they can still cause conflicts.  Sometimes you pull the trigger, but you're already dead on the server (somebody shot you and you don't know it yet) so the action isn't actually performed.  You feel like the game robbed you of a kill because that's what it looked like on your screen. ",9,askscience,67% ,Tue Sep 19 09:26:33 2017 UTC,13,Master_Vicen,2270,783,

Would it be possible to slow light down enough for the naked eye to see it moving?,"Light moves 66% of c in water. Would it be possible to create a liquid(other states of matter also count) in which light moves so slowly so that it's visible with the naked eye? An example: Let's say that we have a curtain of said liquid. If I stand on one side of it, and quickly am to walk to the other side, and looked through the curtain, would I then see a past reflection of myself, one which stands on the other side of the curtain? ","As has been said, light in a medium can be slowed down dramatically, with the most famous examples being in Bose-Einstsein Condensates (BECs).  I just want to add a little niggling issue, which is that you can't see light at all take a path that isn't into your eye.  Hollywood has us primed, for example, to think we can see laser beams, but in reality the only way you can see laser beams is to be directly in its beam or if the room is so filled with crap (i.e. dust, chalk, mist, etc.) for the laser light to hit that enough light is being scattered OUT of the beam and some of it scattering out into your eye. So we think lasers look like this: https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Green-Red-laser-beam.jpg which really only happens in a smoke filled room.

The reason I bring this up is because the goal of ""seeing something interesting while not physically sticking your head into the Bose-Einstein Condensate/laser path"" is at odds with the goal of ""keeping light within the fancy medium"".  Which is not to say no light escapes such experiments (it does and can be detected with finely tuned instruments), but rather that a ""visually interesting"" show to the human eye, means you're doing the experiment REALLY poorly (and, in fact, it may not even work).  Let's say that we have a curtain of said liquid. If I stand on one side of it, and quickly am to walk to the other side, and looked through the curtain, would I then see a past reflection of myself, one which stands on the other side of the curtain?

"Would a stream of fluid which responds to magnetism, like ferrofluid, flow faster or more efficiently through a pipe if a magnet is placed at the opposite end of the stream?","I recently watched this gif on r/blackmagicfuckery, in which magnetic sand falling through an hourglass is responding to a magnet on the base of the glass. This made me wonder if that magnet is causing the sand to flow faster through the hourglass, but I assumed that because the sand molecules were not in constant enough contact with one another, the magnetic field could not permeate up the sand stream and contribute to the flow rate.  But if we were to use ferrofluid, or some other fluid which responds to magnetism, in which the molecules would be in a more constant contact, would that contribute to a faster flow rate? If it does I'm assuming the distance between the magnet/ length of the stream plays a major role. Thinking of potential applications, could this be used to increase flow rates through pipes? like if I needed to increase the flow rate between two tanks of fluid, could I add some ferrofluid, or ironfilings, etc, to one of the tanks and a magnet to the other?

Eagle Vision Vs. Physics: How can they see a mouse from 2 miles away?,"Hello folks. I have a question that falls at the intersection between neuroscience and physics that has been bugging me recently (I only have a decent background in the former, so physics people, please help). So I recently watched Planet Earth II (which, btw, is absolutely stunning in 4K), and there was a bit on eagles, and how they can spot prey from up to two miles away. I've heard this fact in several other places as well, and I have no reason to distrust it, except... The physics of this seems impossible. For something to be processed and recognized by the visual system, a sufficient number of photons that bounced off the object must fall incident upon the retina. Eagles eat mice. Mice are what, two inches long at the most? The square area of a mouse from two miles must represent less than a trillionth of the photons that impact the retina of the eagle.  I understand how movement detection works with center-surround cells and lateral inhibition, and I'm assuming this must be the mechanism, such that it isn't about acuity of perceiving the mouse, but rather noticing its movement. But even then, I simply don't see how enough photons can hit the eagle's retina to sufficiently drive a conscious response (or fixed-action pattern for you ""consciousness is an exclusively human phenomena"" people) that enables the eagle to see the mouse and go for it. And if we accept this premise as true, what does that say about thresholds of activation for eagle retinas? Single photon detection? ","Let's start with some calculations regarding the stimulus: I think 2 inches is a bit small for a mouse, let's say 4 inches. At a distance of two miles, we can describe the size of the mouse in terms of visual angle as: 2*arc tan ((4 inch / 2) / (2 miles * 63360 inches / mile) = 0.0018 degrees of visual angle ~= 0.11 arcmin.  Just to give a point of reference: on a standard eye chart for the 6/6 or 20/20 row, each character subtends 5 arcmin and you need to have a sensitivity of 1 arcmin to tell some letters apart.  Now there are some physical limitations to the resolution of the eye as determined by photoreceptor size and spacing. However, it turns out that we exhibit hyperacuity so that the resolution for telling apart whether two lines are aligned or offset is actually 5-10 times higher than visual acuity limits set by the eye. For a discussion of this, see Fahle & Poggio (1981) (<- pdf!) and in addition to the first demo, see also here. The idea is roughly something like: the eye collects several discrete samples at a certain resolution and later cells (e.g. in the thalamus) interpolate in both space and time intermediate locations. So our functional resolution, if we can call it that, is actually closer to 0.1-0.5 arcmin = 6-30 arcsec. Which isn't so far off from our initial calculation about the size of the retinal projection of a mouse at a 2 mile distance. In fact, in some cases, sensitivity can even reach below 1 arcsec (0.02 arcmin) (Klein and Levi 1985 <- pdf!).  However, it should be noted that there is a difference, both in terms of acuity and in terms of underlying physiological mechanisms, between vernier acuity which is measured with static stimuli and motion sensitivity. And for an eagle, it's probably not enough to notice a little splotch in a field, but also that it is moving. Perhaps surprisingly, we can actually experience motion without any object actually moving whatsoever. Here is an example. Other examples are motion aftereffects where we experience something in the world as moving even though everything is stationary (like after walking and staring at your feet, you look up and the sidewalk seems to recede away from you). Here is an example. Motion processing is somewhat dissociated from object processing, so really what we want to know is whether the eagle could detect motion at that distance. (Just as an aside to point out the separability of motion mechanisms: for individuals with cataracts who have 20/100 vision, they could still have displacement thresholds (see below) of as low as 50 arc seconds = 0.83 arcmin (Bueno & Hurst 1995 <- pdf!).  Typically what is measured in motion sensitivity is a displacement threshold: what's the minimum distance something needs to move for the motion to be detected. This varies as a function of speed, but for relative motion (motion of an object relative to another / on a non-uniform background), thresholds can be as low as 0.3 arcmin = 18 arc sec (Legge & Campbell 1981). For detection of oscillatory motion in a sinusoidal grating, perhaps only 14 arc sec = 0.23 arcmin (Wright & Johnston 1985 <-pdf!), and for detecting shear motion in random dot patterns, only 5 arc sec = 0.083 arcmin (Nakayama & Tyler 1981 <- pdf!). Now perhaps those aren't quite fair comparisons because it's not one, low contrast thing moving very quickly against a fairly uniform background, and we're talking about humans not eagles, but even so it doesn't seem implausible. I'm not familiar with eagle vision or experiments done on eagles to know in detail where the 2 mile number comes from. If the estimates come solely from receptor size/spacing and do not account for hyperacuity, then they may even have better vision than that. tl;dr based on what we know about the human visual system, this doesn't seem implausible  ",7,askscience,72% ,Sun Sep 17 12:09:18 2017 UTC,7,Mhroberts007,22,15,
"Why do simple words like ""Me"", ""Sun"", ""Water"" etc'... vary between languages?",I'm probably looking at it in a limited time span. But I cannot comprehend how such simple words change over time. I mean we all share common ancestry. different languages should have common core vocabulary. ,"It is generally the case that different languages share a common core vocabulary, assuming that they're related. They're not identical because sound changes are completely regular and exceptionless throughout a language, though they are generally more resistant to being replaced by entirely new words. First, let's talk about sound changes. English, like all Germanic languages, shows a chain of sound changes known as Grimm's law where old *p *t *k became /f θ x/1, old *b *d *g became /p t k/, and old *bʰ *dʰ *gʰ became /b d g/. These sound changes happened everywhere. We see them in words like fish and father, (cf. Latin piscis and pater), three and foot (Latin tri and pes, pedes), hound and what (Latin canis and quod) and a great many others. The point is, wherever Grimm's law could operate, it did. This includes even words that we might think would be resistant to sound change, like pronouns. Most English speakers don't use it anymore, but Grimm's law is also evident in the pronoun thou (Latin tu). Intuitive or not, simple words aren't resistant to sound change. They are, however, generally more resistant to lexical replacement, where a word gets shoved out by another. Pronouns, lower numerals, and nouns for body parts and features of the natural world are often good places to look for related words: for instance, per Buck's A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages, the words for 'night' in Ancient and Modern Greek, Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian, Welsh, Breton, Gothic, Old Norse, Danish, Swedish, Old, Middle, and Modern English, Dutch, Old, Middle, and Modern High German, Lithuanian, Latvian, Old Church Slavonic, Bosnian-Serbian-Croatian, Czech, Polish, and Russian all come from a single source.

Why can humans make such a wide range of vocal sounds compared to other animals?,"To the human ear, it seems like a person can do many more things with their voices than animals can (we can talk/sing/growl/scream/moan/do impersonations/etc. whereas they seem to have a smaller range of things).  Is this because we're adapted to hear differences between the timbres of human sound, or because we have evolved to be able to produce a wider range of timbres? Or maybe animals and humans are both physically capable of producing a wide range of timbers, but animals just make less ""weird"" or unusual noises than humans? Or perhaps there's a different reason I haven't thought of? ","It's almost completely due to physiology. Do to evolution, the way our mouth, throat, vocal chords, etc. are sized and shaped allow us to make a larger set of distinct sounds. It also has to do with just how cognitively complex we are as humans compared to other species. This allows us to have a much broader understanding of language and how it can be used. A lot of research has been done on language in extinct hominids and while some would suggest that some (ex. Homo neanderthalensis) had as complex languages as us, most accept that they used a combination of basic sounds like grunts in combination with body language to communicate.

What would hurt more saltwater or freshwater?,"If you were to jump into a freshwater lake vs jumping into salt water, will the impact be harder on your body for one or the same for both?  Hypothetically if you could replicate both jumps from the exact same height, landing the exact same way and both bodies of water were the exact same temperature ","As I see it, there are two considerations: surface tension; and, density.

Whereas, for pure water, is around 73 mN/m. So, fresh water is ""harder"". However, since the force you experience would be from mass X acceleration, the density of the fluid you are displacing would dominate over the surface effect. Seawater, as an example of salt water, is 2.5 - 3% more dense than fresh water.  I can't calculate the force one would generate, due to too many unknown variables, mass, height (velocity) and surface are of impact, and associated deceleration.

Around 4'30"", there's mention of virtual particles and a spaceship.  They move on from this idea quickly, but it got me curious. Is there a reference frame for virtual particle production?  It seems to me that pair production generally is relatively low energy particles (the video suggests it is less common at higher energy), but the energy of a particle is relative to the observer.  Virtual particles which are low energy in one reference frame might be thought of as extremely high energy to someone traveling close to the speed of light relative to that frame.  Are virtual particles always in some particular reference frame? I suppose another way to imagine this is to look at the Casimir effect.  If I had two close plates in a very fast rocket, oriented perpendicular to the direction of travel, the plates would be different distances apart depending on whether I am on the rocket or stationary relative to the rocket (due to Lorenz contraction).  But it seems paradoxical that there would be different forces measured between the plates. Is there a better way of thinking of this, or am I missing something entirely?

Can you analytically find the probability for a sequence of numbers to have at least one digit in the correct order?,"Can you analytically find the probability of a sequence of numbers that has at least one digit in the correct order? self.askscience submitted 2 days ago  (*last edited 22 hours ago) by chunkybeefbombs For example, with a 3-number sequence, the possible sequences are 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321. 123 and 321 have the 2 in the second spot, 123 and 132 have the 1 in the first spot, and 213 and 123 have the 3 in the third spot. That means the probability for a sequence to have one number in the right place for three terms is 0.67. Is there a way to calculate the probability for larger sequences that at least one digit will be in its correct spot? ","A permutation of the numbers {1, 2, 3, ..., n} such that no number appears in its original position is called a derangement. Let dn denote the number of derangements of a set with n elements. (Of course, you are asking for n!-dn, the number of permutations with at least one fixed point, but it's a bit easier to calculate dn directly.) There is a clever way of calculating a recurrence for dn. Think of the n elements as envelopes that will be matched with N letters. The number dn counts the number of ways no envelope gets matched with its letter if we do the matching in a completely random way.  Suppose we attempt to match envelope #1 first. There are precisely n-1 outcomes in which this envelope is not matched correctly. So suppose envelope #1 is not matched and ends up getting matched with letter #k (with k not equal to 1). Now let's attempt to match envelope #k. If this envelope gets matched to letter #1, then the entire problem has been reduced to finding the derangements of n-2 envelopes. (It's as if we envelope/letter #1 and #k were never there to begin with.) If envelope #k gets matched to some other letter, then the entire problem has been reduced instead to finding the derangements of n-1 envelopes. (Now, it's a bit more subtle to see that, but the point is that after envelope #1 is matched to letter #k, the remaining envelopes have only one letter they cannot be matched with if we want a derangement. Since we have included the case where envelope #k gets matched with letter #1 in Step #2, we can equivalently say that letter #1 is the ""match"" for envelope #k in Step #3.) Putting this all together gives the recurrence  dn = (N-1)(dn-2 + dn-1)  That is, the total number of derangements of the original set first branch into N-1 possibilities when envelope #1 is matched to letter #k. But for each of these possibilities, we have the D(N-2) derangements from Step #2 and the D(N-1) derangements from Step #3.  The recurrence  dn = (n-1)dn-2 + (n-1)dn-1  is a second-order, linear recurrence relation, and must be supplemented by two ""initial conditions"". A set with 1 element has precisely 0 derangements since any permutation of 1 element always puts that element in the correct position. A set with 2 elements has precisely 1 derangement since of the 2 possible permutations, only 1 of them is an actual derangement. Hence we have the conditions  d1 = 0   and   d2 = 1  This is a second-order, linear recurrence relation with non-constant coefficients. Such relations are generally very difficult, maybe impossible, to solve analytically. This pdf of lecture notes contains some examples of such relations and how to solve them.  Luckily, the relation for dn can be solved exactly. The solution is  dn = n!*(1 - 1/2! + 1/3! - 1/4! + ... + (-1)n/n!)  In other words, the number  dn/n!,  which is the ratio of derangements to total permutations, is equal to the terms of the Taylor series for e-x (evaluated at x = 1) truncated at the xn-term. It immediately follows that if n is very large, then dn/n! ~ e-1. So for large n, the approximate proportion of derangements is 37%. Equivalently, the number of permutations with at least one correct match is about 63% for large n. ",0,askscience,50% ,Sat Sep 16 00:43:27 2017 UTC,7,chunkybeefbombs,1,0,

Does a Field in Physics always exist (as an expample: the electric field) even when no Particles of that field interact with eachother?,,"Yes it does.  It might seem like a philosophical question, but it's not, it has real observable effects.  1) Even if a quantum field has a zero ""vacuum expectation value"" (VEV), which is to say, that it is ""empty"" of excitations (i.e. particles)., the vacuum state itself still has a rich structure of quantum fluctuations about its ""average zero value"" that can cause real effects like the Casimir effect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect 2) Most particle fields have zero VEVs (i.e. when there's no ""particles"" their average value is zero).  However, a famous example of a field where this isn't true is the Higgs field.  What is special about the Higgs field is that even without any excitation, its VEV is non-zero.  Thus, even when the field is ""empty"" it still has a constant value.  It is some particle's coupling to this non-zero vacuum value that essentially gives them mass (being vague here). You may have heard of the Higgs Boson, and you may have asked: ""If this particle only occurs at such crazy high energies such that you need a particle accelerator to make it, why do we care?"" , well that's basically right.  Most people don't care about the boson itself, it doesn't matter much.  But rather, its existence proves that the FIELD exists and that was key.  We'd assumed for a very long time that there was this field with a non-zero VEV that was responsible for this clearly observed effect of mass in some things that ought not, naively, to have mass, but we could never experimentally probe the field itself.  It wasn't until we could ""smack"" the field hard enough to produce an excitation (a particle) that we could detect that we could prove the field itself was there and that this Anderson-Higgs mechanism was real.

At this point, voltage-gated sodium channels close, voltage-gated potassium channels open, and K+ ion efflux repolarizes the membrane to a resting potential of -70 mV, at which point Na+/K+ pumps start to function. However, non-gated potassium channels are still open, and K+ ions are still diffusing out of the membrane through these leak channels, creating hyper-polarization. Na+ is stuck in the axon at this point, as well. The closing of the K+ channels, plus Na+/K+ pump activity, restores membrane charge to threshold, with Na+ ions on the outside and K+ ions on the inside. This explanation seems pretty flawed to me. The Na+/K+ pump transports 3 Na+ ions out for every 2 K+ ions it transports in. If it kicks in during the refractory period, which is caused by leak channels allowing the escape of positively-charged potassium ions, wouldn't it decrease the membrane's positive charge even further by forcing 3 positively charged ions out for every 2 it pushes in? How does the membrane return to resting potential? ","I didn't mention a nucleus, I mentioned a neuron. And although the action potential originates in the axon hillock, the actual ions flow in through the dendrites, making the soma of the neuron change its charge and so have the charge originate in the nucleus.  Then those ions create the potential difference and the action potential begins at the axon hillock.  The refractory period is caused by the interesting structure of the voltage-gated sodium channels. They have a ball and chain protein attachment which literally swings up and blocks the channel, like an old tub with the chain and plug. Then, the potential starts to be more negative as potassium ions flow out.  The ball and chain releases, however, the voltage is now different, so the sodium channels are closed because of that reason.  The thing is, there is lots more potassium inside the neuron than out, so because of the concentration gradient a lot of the potassium ions flow out. However, as the potential becomes more negative because of the potassium flowing out and the sodium potassium pump, the potassium ions(as they are positive) are being drawn in because of the charge difference, and the rate of flow out(because of concentration gradient) and in(because of charge gradient) is equal. The potassium channels and the sodium potassium pumps work in tandem to keep the resting potential stable.  ",1,askscience,67% ,Sat Sep 16 01:26:11 2017 UTC,6,MemeticMonstrosity,33,1,
"When riding my bicycle, I can stop pedalling, make a 180-degree turn, and the bike still continues moving (though at much lower speed) in the opposite direction. Why?","Momentum is directional and as far as I can see there is no other input energy being applied to the bike (or me), so how can it move in the opposite direction? ","When you turn the front wheel by turning the steering bar, the front wheel is turned to be out of line with the direction of motion. Yet the momentum of the bike keeps pushing it forward. This causes the front wheel (and by extension, the bike) to exert a force on the ground (perpendicular to the direction of the wheel). Due to Newton's Third Law, this force on the ground is met by an equal and opposite force from the ground working on the bike. It is this force that alters the momentum of the bike, rotating it in the direction that you're steering. For this process to work, the wheel must be able to exert a force on the ground. Therefore, it must have grip. Trying to turn on a very slippery surface (e.g. ice) will have very different effects. edit: The force exerted by the bike also slightly alters the momentum of the Earth. The total momentum of the combined Earth+bike system is still conserved. But due to the non-trivial difference in mass between the Earth and the bike with its rider, the effect on the Earth is completely negligible.

Why do we need quantum theories to explain what happens to light with multiple polarization filters ?,"Hi, I just watched a video from YouTube channel minutephysics. It's this video. The first thing that crossed my mind was - ""wait, are you joking me?"". Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not here to joke around and I don't want to sound arrogant, but that's exactly what my thought was when I saw them putting a filter between filters like a magician trying to do a trick. I even asked myself - ""But why didn't you put a filter over a 90 degree rotated filter and then tell me that it got brighter? Huh? Gotcha!"". Then I watched it until the end, and I realized that they went too far in quantum state of particles and the determinism logic which isn't intuitive to anyone, and that my assumptions were totally based on classical physics or don't need no quantum theories like the entanglement in order to explain to me what happened in the video. I also jumped to the comments section and I could see a few people asking the same thing, but always getting redirected to how the entanglement doesn't work that way, even though they didn't mention any entanglement at all. So, this is what I think happens. The logic is very simple. First, we have 2 filters. The filter A, and filter C. The filter C is rotated 45 degrees, which lets 50% of light, or in other words, blocks 50% of it. We also happen to know that a filter rotated 22.5 degrees (half of 45 degrees), lets 85% of light, or again, blocks 15% of light, which magically is not 25%, but I'll get to it. Now, when we introduce a filter B, which we put in between filters A and C, we see the light getting brighter. But, if we concluded that filters rotate the wave of light, the filter C is now ALSO rotated 22.5 degrees to the filter B, which blocks only 15%. The math is 15% + 15% = 30%. Of course that it is brighter. Now, the tricky and the second part is about the thing I said I'll get to it, and what I also wanted to ask reddit. What if the light wave (or filters) are simply not distributed as a standard gaussian distribution model, but they have a slightly smaller variance (the deviation from a standard mean), so that the half from a mean angle gives probability density of 15% and not 25% ? Wouldn't that explain everything? Why would we need entangled particles, realism and locality to explain this? What am I missing? ","QM has nothing to do with this- it's a purely classical effect. You seem pretty confused about this whole setup, so I'm going to start from the beginning.  The fundamental laws of classical electromagnetism are Maxwell's equations. They are, in differential form and natural units:  Div B = 0 Div E = Rho Curl E = -dB/dt Curl B = J + dE/dt  Where B is the magnetic field, E is the electric field, rho is the charge density, and J is the current density.  For the sake of convenience, we'll say that Rho and J are both zero- the net charge at any point is zero, and there's no net flow of charges through any point.  Combining 3 and 4, we get Curl Curl E = - Curl dB/dt = -d/dt Curl B = -d2 E/dt2  Applying some vector calculus identities, we get the wave equation- d2 E/dt2 = d2 E /dx2 + d2 E/dy2 + d2 E/dz2 . As the name suggests, solutions to this differential equation are waves- the electromagnetic field has waves, and in natural units, they propagate at speed 1 (i.e., the speed of light).  Now, this is a linear differential equation, so the sum of any two solutions is also a solution. The physical implications of this are that, when two light waves are passing through the same point, the field there is just the sum of the contributions of either wave.  Now, we need to talk about polarization. We can see from the wave equation that the electric field has to propagate as a sine wave along every axis- but nothing fixes the phases of its components. If E_x and E_y are completely in phase, then when one is at its largest value, so is the other- this is linear polarization. Given any two sinusoids with different linear polarizations, you can express every other possible sinusoid along the same axis as a linear combination of those two. In mathematical terminology, sinusoids along an axis form a two dimensional vector space.  Now, let's say we have a filter that only allows light polarized at a 45 degree angle- which I'm going to call (1,1) for convenience. We pass vertically polarized light - (0,1) - through it. Well, (0,1) = 1/sqrt(2)(1,1) + 1/sqrt(2)(-1,1), so what we get out is 1/sqrt(2)(1,1)- our light has been dimmed by a factor of sqrt(2). The important thing to note here is that, while we've rotated halfway to horizontal, our intensity has decreased by a lot less than half. If we do the same thing again, but with a filter that only lets through (1,0) light, we'll end up with half our original intensity.  Now, let's try the same thing again, but with three filters. The first only lets through (1,sqrt(3)) light, the second only lets through (sqrt(3),1) light, and the third only lets through (1,0) light.  (0,1) = 1/(2sqrt(3))(3(1,sqrt(3)) - sqrt(3)(sqrt(3),-1))), so we get out sqrt(3)/2 of our original intensity. Repeat three times, and we're at about 65% of the original intensity when we get to horizontal.  This is getting long, so I'm not going to work through the math here, but this holds in general- as you add more evenly spaced filters, the total loss in intensity goes down, and in the limit of infinitely many filters, light comes out the other side just as bright as it went in.

Why are the different gas giants different colors?,Presumably the material they were made of was all the same gas cloud. Why do the different planets then have such dramatically different colors? ,"The primary reason is temperature. Jupiter, the warmest of the giant planets in our Solar System, is covered in whites and browns. Note that almost everything you see when you look at Jupiter is ammonia clouds, which on their own are bright white. Some latitudes are regions of upwelling (zones), and have high ammonia cloud-tops, while other latitudes are regions of downwelling (belts), and have low ammonia cloud-tops, as shown in this diagram. In between these high and low heights sits a thick brown hydrocarbon haze (not shown in the diagram), very chemically similar to smog. The cloud-tops in the zones are sticking up above most of the haze and thus appear fairly white. The cloud-tops in the belts, though, lie below the haze layer, and thus appear colored brown by the overlying haze. Moving on to Saturn, where it's a good deal colder, that hydrocarbon haze can now reach much higher heights above the cloud tops. It's still all ammonia clouds under there, but the overlying haze now means the entire planet is covered in a brownish-tan hue. Getting out to Uranus & Neptune, which are now cold enough to form methane haze, there's a sudden change in color. It turns out methane is very good at absorbing red light, meaning the only light left to reflect is bluish-green light, and thus gives both planets their characteristic color. Every now and then you'll also see bright white methane clouds peaking out over the methane haze on these planets, though more prominently on Neptune - most likely because it has a much greater internal heat source than Uranus (for reasons we don't really understand yet).

What liquid is the wettest?,I'm sure wettest is the wrong word. I'm trying to ask what liquid would soak through the most layers of say paper towels or whatever. Like per tablespoon which liquid soaks the most.  ,"""Wettest"" or ""wetting"" are perfectly fine words to use. Predicting the wettest liquid for a given material requires consideration of the liquid's and material's surface energies as well as the interfacial tension between the two phases. Essentially, the wettest liquid is one that gives the lowest interfacial tension as well as having a low surface energy itself. Definitively describing this, however, is tricky as the three surface/ interfacial energies are not independent of each other and all values must be determined to fully describe/ predict outcomes in the system. For capillary action, as you have described, the height of liquid uptake into capillaries of a given diameter can be determine from Jurin's law. The gamma X cosine term is equal to (solid surface energy) - (interfacial energy). So to maximise this term, and in turn the height of uptake, the surface energy of the solid must be higher than that of the interface, i.e. the interface must be more energetically favourable to form. This is why most porous solids soak up most liquids - solid surface energies are nearly always higher than liquid-solid interfaces. An interesting example of the opposite effect is liquid mercury - you cant use a paper towel to clear up a mercury spill as the mercury will not be taken up by the capillaries. Instead it's expelled from them as the interfacial tension is too high or, in other words, the mercury doesn't wet the cellulose towel.

When did we know space debris and dust was such a big problem?,Did we think of it before a major incident or was an early space craft unexpectedly ripped to shreds? ,"At the beginning of the space era they supposed it could happen. We've always known micrometeoroids exist because we have several meteor showers per year on Earth. But there was not enough data to estimate their flux or size distribution and the probability of an impact (estimates from observations of meteor showers must have been very rough, if they existed at all). Fun fact: when they heard a loud bang in the Apollo 13 mission, at first they thought they had been hit by a meteoroid, it was later confirmed to be the rupture of an oxygen tank, most likely not meteoroid-related. It was much later that we had precise estimates. Most of the data we have today comes from NASA's LDEF (Long-Duration Exposure Facility) and ESA's Eureca (European Retrievable Carrier). Both of them stayed in orbit for several years, containing samples of different materials and exposing them to all the environmental hazards of space.

"What, if any, are the differences between a man-made vaccum and the vaccum of space?",,"Not many, but there are a few. First of all, it's never a perfect vacuum, just extremely low pressure. Humans can't breathe, water can't be held in a liquid state, but a few air molecules are still bouncing around. The vacuum of space is exposed to UV rays from sunlight. These have a ionizing effect that can break molecular bonds. As a result, oxygen molecules are broken into lone atoms (often called ""atomic oxygen""). These aren't stable, so they will try to recombine with the first thing they find along their path to make a molecule. Engineers designing satellites must be aware of this and make an appropriate choice of materials that won't degrade when exposed to atomic oxygen. Plastics are particularly vulnerable. Glass fiber, which is naturally an oxide, and aluminium, which forms a thin layer of oxide in the surface that protects the rest inside, resist quite well. This isn't a problem in a vacuum chamber on Earth. The other difference is thermal control through radiated heat. This isn't a property of the vacuum, but of the chamber you're in. The walls of the vacuum chamber will radiate heat to the inside, from all directions, at a moderate power determined by their temperature. In space, you'll receive a lot of power from sunlight, some power from Earth or whatever planetary body you're close to, and almost nothing from deep space. Satellites and probes must be properly designed to maintain a controlled temperature in this environment. ",4,askscience,76% ,Mon Sep 11 22:48:57 2017 UTC,3,that_one_salty_guy,1574,53,

I get really confused thinking about the galaxy we live in and had some question regarding it and was hoping for some help understanding some of these confusions..," What is (or could be) the oldest thing in our galaxy? Does being the oldest define the age of our galaxy or does its size define the age of our galaxy?  Or are the they same? Do older or younger things within our galaxy potentially have more complexity and/or more or less intelligence?  What I mean by this, is that if a black hole is one of the oldest things and has been around for billions of years, does that mean it has more information or knowledge compared to an AI system developed on Earth today?  I'm not sure if this question even makes sense or if I'm comparing things which are not comparable. Why does it seem that the older things within the galaxy, the bigger they are, and the newer things are the smaller they are? I remember back in high school science it (may) was mentioned that they couldn't explain the rotation of spiral galaxies, in the sense that it all rotated at the same speed, from the inside to the outer arm.  Is this understanding still true or not?  If not, what is the current understanding?  Thank you very much. "," What is (or could be) the oldest thing in our galaxy?  At the moment I believe the object discussed in this paper is the oldest known object in the Milky Way. It is informally known as the Methuselah star. Age determination for stars is not as precise as we would like, but it is thought to have formed very shortly after the Big Bang.   Does being the oldest define the age of our galaxy or does its size define the age of our galaxy? Or are the they same?  Not exactly. Some of the oldest structures in the Milky Way (globular clusters) provide some limits on the age of the galaxy. It is very likely that the Milky Way began forming almost as soon as possible in cosmological history. Galaxies are dynamic, and often during their lifetime capture smaller collections of stars, so it is not easy to define a singular age, unlike a star.   if a black hole is one of the oldest things and has been around for billions of years, does that mean it has more information or knowledge compared to an AI system developed on Earth today?  No. There is no reason to suspect that black holes, or any astrophysical objects, are intelligent. Information, in the context of black holes, is almost certainly not in a form useful for intelligent life.   Why does it seem that the older things within the galaxy, the bigger they are, and the newer things are the smaller they are?  This is incorrect. In the case of stars, the largest stars evolve and die the fastest. a 100 solar mass star is gone after a few million years. A star like the sun will last billions. So it is extremely likely that a large star is actually the younger object. Nevertheless there is not a simple relation between age and size; you have to consider the physics of the object in question.   couldn't explain the rotation of spiral galaxies, in the sense that it all rotated at the same speed, from the inside to the outer arm.   The galaxy rotation curve tells you how fast stars are rotating around the center of a galaxy, as a function of the radius from the center. The speeds of the stars depend on the gravitational potential of the galaxy. You can make a prediction of what this potential is, and hence what the curve would look like, by measuring the matter you can see in the galaxy with a telescope. Measurements of this curve, made by directly measuring the speeds of the stars in a galaxy, conflict with this prediction. This is the origin of why we think dark matter exists. It is merely matter we cannot see, which modifies the galactic potential so that the measured rotation curves make sense. The other hypothesis, modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), is to invoke a scale dependence of gravity on distance, which accounts for the rotation curve.  At the moment, there are some really good reasons to believe that dark matter exists. (MOND has much less support behind it.) What, exactly, it is remains unknown. Perhaps it is just ordinary matter too cold for us to see. Perhaps dark matter is small black holes. Perhaps it is a gas of weakly-interacting particles that don't interact electromagnetically. There are arguments for or against these ideas; perhaps dark matter is a mixture of these things, or something else we haven't thought of. All we know is that, short of modifying gravity, that matter has to be there.  ",4,askscience,61% ,Wed Sep 13 05:05:53 2017 UTC,8,xow,208,126,

"How can the size of a jigsaw puzzle be estimated when pulling pieces one at a time out of a bag at random, and on average how many pieces will need to be pulled before the exact size of the puzzle can be determined?","If the pieces from a rectangular jigsaw puzzle of an unknown piece count are emptied into a bag and then pulled out one at a time at random, with an estimate on the total number of pieces in the puzzle being made after each piece is revealed, how should that estimate be calculated using the following information?  Whether the piece pulled out is an edge, corner, or field piece. whether the piece pulled out connects to any piece(s) already pulled out.  On average, how many puzzle pieces will it take before we can say with certainty the size of the puzzle? Assume the puzzle has no picture on it to help place the pieces, and that the pieces are laid out in the typical jigsaw puzzle format, with each piece being roughly the same size as all the others and the pieces arranged in a grid pattern with no duplicate pieces. Also, I'm sure the aspect ratio of the puzzle makes a difference, but I'm not sure how it would affect the process so I'll leave that open. ","A great problem, and probably something you can write a master thesis on. Some assumptions:  Edge and corner pieces are recognizable as such If two pieces fit together, we always know this. We cannot use any sort of pattern on the pieces. Apart from the previous two bullet points we have no idea where a piece belongs to.  Some initial thoughts: You can make estimates based on the relative number of center (M) and edge (E) pieces, but different length to height ratios will lead to different E to M ratios. All you get that way is a lower limit on the size (corresponding to square puzzles, asymmetric puzzles will have the same ratio at a larger overall size). Corner pieces (C) help: There are just 4 of them, if you draw the first one it doesn't tell you much, but with the second one you can be reasonably confident that the puzzle is not too much larger than what you have already. The third and fourth will refine these estimates even more. You know the length or height once you have a continuous connection between the corresponding edges (you don't need to have them in a straight line). This is a problem in percolation theory. In the limit of infinite puzzle size, you need on average half the puzzle pieces for this if I remember correctly. There is another heuristic estimate, and one that will lead to a reliable (but not exact) estimate the fastest: Count the number of connections you found. I don't have an exact formula, but in a puzzle of N pieces (N>>1), the probability that two random pieces are next to each other is approximately 4/N. With sqrt(N) pieces drawn your expected number of connections is 2, while your expected number of corner pieces is 4. With 2sqrt(N) pieces drawn you expect 8 connections and 8 corner pieces. With 4sqrt(N) pieces drawn you expect 32 connections and 16 corner pieces. The number of connections grows much faster, with its inevitable sqrt(observed) scaling it gives a more reliable estimate than the corner pieces. In addition, its dependence on the overall puzzle shape is much smaller. ",17,askscience,85% ,Mon Sep 11 23:45:03 2017 UTC,10,Senno_Ecto_Gammat,16738,159501,

Were cyclones more powerful when the Earth was covered in superoceans?,"Are there simulations? Did they leave any geological record as the supermonsoon did? Are there limiting factors after a certain ocean size/cyclone size or did more warm ocean equal more energy to the storms? How long did they last? Can we compare them to known cyclones on other planets?

","TL;DR yes, but not by virtue of superoceans themselves. I am not sure of the effects of supercontinents on their own, but I can answer this question in the context of Earth's history, specifically the end Permian mass extinction event, which took place in the time of Pangaea. I am a graduate student in geology and currently studying mass extinction events. /u/Neolavitz is right in that the biggest limiting factor for tropical storm growth is ocean water temperature. To elaborate... When certain conditions are met, the oceans can become very warm. One such warming event (called a Hothouse state) took place at the end of the Permian, when the Great Dying occurred. It is thought that this Hothouse state was triggered by a massive eruption at the Siberian Traps, which released enormous amounts of CO2 and other nasty compounds onto the surface of the planet. One of the consequences of this was dramatically slowed ocean circulation in a haline mode. A haline mode ""generates warm saline bottom water that heats the ocean"" (166), which transfers heat from the equator to the poles. This is in contrast to our present cycle, where deep ocean currents transport cold water to low latitudes, creating a gradient of heat and overall cooler oceans worldwide. In the Hothouse state, cyclones, which are restricted to about 40 degrees of latitude N or S in our current climatic regime, may traverse the entire globe (90N and 90S) thanks to worldwide elevated ocean temperatures. They would also create a positive feedback situation:  As storms reached to higher latitudes, they would help deliver more heat to those regions. That would, in turn, further warm higher latitude surface waters, making it more likely that subsequent storms would have an ever-greater poleward reach. Polar storms would also lead to increased polar cloudiness, which would impede surface heat radiation to space, thus warming the poles even more.  Magntitude of storms would increase. Modern cyclones are limited in their size by colder, deeper waters. The bases of their waves reach the colder deep waters and lose heat and energy. In a warmed ocean, this restraint would no longer exist. Kidder and Worsley specifically say, ""the cyclone-magnitude governor would be completely removed in a Hothouse..."" (emphasis mine). So to answer your third question, no, there are theoretically no limiting factors in a very warm, humid situation. To answer your fourth question, the vast, dry deserts of Pangaea were the most likely stopping zones for these storms, as they would be deprived of moisture in the deserts.

"Uncertainty in position allows a particle to tunnel from one position in space to another, could uncertainty in time (Energy-Time uncertainty) allow a particle to tunnel from one instance in time to another?","If it could happen in some way analogous to standard quantum tunneling, there'd have to be some sort of confinement in time, though I'm not sure what could even mean. ","The energy-time uncertainty principle is different from the others. Usually, you have observables in quantum mechanics which have some sort of probabilistic distribution, and the normal uncertainty relation is given as σA σB ≥ something where σA is the standard deviation of the distribution describing A, and ""something"" depends on the properties of the observables A and B. (""something"" can be zero, where the uncertainty principle just tells you that standard deviations are positive; it can't be negative). But time is not an ""observable"" in the technical sense I gave above, because there is no probability distribution for the time of the system, so there's no standard deviation. The time is just a parameter which the probability distributions of all the observables depend on. This basically answers your question: time cannot ""tunnel,"" it doesn't have a distribution and can't ""collapse"" etc. So what is the correct statement about the energy-time uncertainty principle? It is the following: Consider any observable (once again, in the sense I have in the first paragraph) B. Now consider the energy, E. The following is true: σE σB ≥ (ħ/2)|d<B>/dt|  Here, <B> is the average value (mean) of the observable B. If the average value of B doesn't change with time, then there's nothing interesting to say here. But if B is changing with time, then there will always be an uncertainty relation between E and B. Let's think about what this means physically. If you have a system where some observable B is changing, then the energy of that system must not be well-defined - instead there is some spread. This must be true, in particular, for any unstable system, since an unstable system is defined as one which is changing w.r.t. some observable. So unstable systems have some distribution of energies which must satisfy σE Δt ≥ ħ/2 where Δt = σB/|d<B>/dt| is sometimes called the ""time uncertainty."" You can think of Δt as the approximate time it takes for <B> to change by an amount σB. If this amount of time is large (which happens for stable systems with long lifetimes), then the energy uncertainty is small. Vice-versa, if this amount of time is small (e.g. in unstable systems), the energy will have a very large spread.  ",22,askscience,81% ,Tue Sep 12 01:22:04 2017 UTC,6,iaswob,8791,20536,

How do alambric headphones work without a battery?,,"""Alambric"" sounds like a literal translation into English, I assume you meant ""wired"". Signals do carry a little bit of power. Headphones are basically very small speakers, just like any other kind of speakers they work when electricity traverses a coil, producing a magnetic field, which interacts with a fixed magnet. As electricity changes intensity/direction, the coil moves closer or farther from the fixed magnet, pushing the speaker's membrane to generate the vibration we perceive as sound. Since the speakers in your headphones are so small and require so little power, the signal in the wire is more than enough. (This would also work in theory if you connect bigger speakers to your phone, but in practice the volume of sound will be so low that you will only hear it barely and in a very quiet environment. If you want more volume, you'll need an amplifier and it will use an external power source.) It also depends on the fact that it's an analog signal.

Larger stars than the sun are hotter and have more pressure to eventually fuse elements up to around iron/nickel. At this point fusion becomes energetically unfavorable and once the iron core becomes large enough it can collapse and form a supernova. The intense heat and enormous amounts of neutrons released in the supernova can fuse much heavier elements like uranium.

Why the exciter power rating in large generators is so small compared to the generators power rating?,As I learned the generators in power plants don't use permanent magnets but electro-magnets instead. This is quite interesting - you need electricity for electric generator. Why you only need let's say 2.5MW of (electric) power for powering the exciter/electromagnets although the output of generator is 100MW? Isn't the magnetic field in generator (maintained by exciter) opposed if you put a load on the generator? I still tend to think that if you draw 1MW from generator its magnetic field is opposed by 1MW. I know the extra power comes from let's say falling water (in case of hydro) but is still can't wrap my head around all that work-balance of magnetic fields. ,"You don't lose power from the magentic field. You only need energy to setup the magnetic field, after that you technically need zero power to sustain the magnetic field. The only reason it actually takes power is loses, like the resistance in the rotor coils. Once the field is set up, it certainly feels an opposing force to its rotation, but the prime mover (turbine, engine) supplies the torque to overcome that and hence deliver electrical power.   Consider that you can use a permanent magnet instead. Energy went into making the permanent magnet, but after that it can run a generator indefintely. You don't run a generator on magnets and have to change them out as they die like batteries. Energy isn't being drained from the magentic field.

This video does a great job of showing how that process can overwhelm the distribution system. Power is generated at a high voltage 13200 VAC in the US. (This video appears to be a Caribbean country so the actual voltage is unknown to me but the principles are the same) It is more effecient to deliver high voltage to the point of use then step it down at the source. In this case the big explosion at the end was the step down transformer. That transformer changes the voltage down to a more usable number. Some US examples are 4160VAC, 480VAC, 208/240VAC. There is no way to know what the stepped down voltage was. Suffice to say the fire on the ground at the beginning of the video was a downed live power line of an unknown stepped down voltage. At the beginning of the video the power generator station is still supplying high voltage to the step down transformer, the step down transformer is doing its job providing power down stream to the downed power lines. The fire in the streets is live voltage traveling to ground.  As it passes to ground it is overcoming resistance and converting to heat.  That process is what fuels the fire. Eventually the resistance to ground is overcome and the voltage finds an unrestricted (or rather less restricted) path to ground. At that point the amp draw increases so much that the transformer blows.  Either the internal windings inside the transformer failed and created a short or the resistance between the high voltage points feeding the air was overcome and the final explosion occurred. That final explosion was two separate out of phase legs of power meeting and shorting to each other. At that point either an upstream fuse or a the generator itself failed causing a wide spread power outage. ",7,askscience,67% ,Sun Sep 10 09:43:58 2017 UTC,4,xpostfact,288,7823,
A while back on NPR I heard that there are different Capsaicinoids that give different heat profiles to hot peppers. Could someone elaborate on this?,"IIRC it was on an episode of Science Friday. They were specifically discussing how the various hot peppers (jalapenos, habaneros, etc.) had fundamentally different capsaicinoids which react in different ways to the heat receptors in tongues and, in turn, have different heat profiles. ","Chillies synthesise a number capsaicinoid chemicals, 5 of which are naturally occurring. Largely they differ by the length of the aliphatic tail. Capsaicin is the most abundant with a Scoville rating of around 16 million and Homocapsaicin is the least abundant with a Scoville rating about half that of Capsaicin. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin#Capsaicinoids The mode of action for capsaicinoids is to bind the TRPV1 ion channel on the surface of heat sensing nerves in the mouth, oesophagus and gut. On binding the capsaicinoids force the channel to be open and this causes the nerve to continually fire. Ultimately the different capsaicinoids display different binding kinetics for the TRVP1 receptor. That is, the rate at which they bind or unbind is slightly different for each chemical and the degree to which they can hold open the ion channel, while bound, also differs.

Bernoulli Question - What frame of reference to use?,"So if you're in a closed convertible traveling on a highway, relative to the car the air is moving fast, which causes low pressure and pulls the roof of the car upwards. But motion is relative - the air inside the car is moving fast relative to the air outside the car - shouldn't this cause the roof to pull downwards? Obviously both can't be true - how can you determine which frame of reference to use? ","Bernoulli's equation is actually not Galilean invariant. This means that the equation has a different form in different reference frames. The most common form of Bernoulli's principle is for steady flow of an ideal fluid, which states that the quantity  H = p/ϱ + u2/2 + χ  (where p = pressure, ϱ = fluid density, u = fluid velocity, and χ = external potential) is constant along streamlines. If the flow is also irrotational, then H is constant throughout the entire fluid. The principle can be summarized as (u · ∇)H = 0. The problem with this equation is that it does not hold in an arbitrary inertial frame. Indeed, how could it?  What is steady flow in one frame is not necessarily steady flow in another frame. Bernoulli's equation is derived from conservation of energy. Hence, in particular, for a frame in which ""obstacles"" have some non-zero velocity, the equation is wrong because we have to add a term to the equation (u · ∇)H = 0 which represents the work done on the fluid by those moving ""obstacles"". (""Obstacle"" here is a general term and can also refer to a constriction.) This is really not a surprise since it is well-known that constraint forces can do work. So when we change frames, we have to be very careful of taking account of such forces. For instance, a fairly common and accessible introductory physics question is that of a block sliding down a plane with friction. If we were to examine the scenario from a frame which moves uniformly with respect to the block+plane system, and not take account of the constraint forces, we would find some naive contradictions in energy conservation. The fundamental principle is that the change in kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the total work done on the particle. In other words, the change in kinetic energy is the line integral of F(t) along the path of the particle. This principle is frame-independent and is always true. However, if the forces are conservative and time-independent, we can introduce a scalar potential, and then we get the arguably more common form of energy conservation in the equation T + U = const. But in a frame that is moving with respect to an obstacle or constriction in a fluid, the force is not time-independent. So to find the correct form of Bernoulli's equation, we have to appeal to the fundamental work-energy theorem instead of something akin to ""T + U = constant"". In fact, there is another common form of Bernoulli's equation for irrotational, unsteady flow, which again states that (u · ∇)H = 0, but now where H is given by  H = p/ϱ + u2/2 + χ + ∂φ/∂t  where φ is the velocity potential. This added term includes any work done on the fluid by the moving obstacles. For a more general fluid, we would possibly have to add other terms to account for other constraints (particularly if the fluid is not irrotational).  edit: As for the question about air rushing into a car, let's use Bernoulli's principle in the following form. If the flow is steady and irrotational, then the quantity  H = p/ϱ + u2/2 + gh  is constant throughout the fluid. (This is the most commonly stated form of Bernoulli's principle.) Given what I explained above, if you want to appeal to this principle, we must consider the flow from the rest frame of the car. If the flow along the car is steady and irrotational, then we can very easily show that the pressure inside the car should be higher than the pressure just outside the car, and so there should be a flow of air out of the car near the windows. Indeed, this is actually what happens. But the big caveat here is that the flow has to be steady and irrotational. So if you want to verify this for yourself, you should crack open the window only a very small amount, so as to make sure the flow is as close to steady and, more important, irrotational as much as you can make it. Hold a piece of a paper near the crack and it will be pushed outward toward the window. If you open the windows too much, then there is a very strong flow separation along the car. Vortex shedding will occur at the leading edge of the windows, thus making the flow both very not irrotational and very unsteady. So Bernoulli's principle as stated above simply does not hold.

Does detonating two nuclear bombs side by side have the same effect as detonating one doubly-large bomb?,,"No, it's more effective to use multiple bombs. If we lived in space then things might be different, but our cities are on the surface of the Earth, and that means they tend to be mostly planar.

Bigger bombs need to be detonated at higher altitudes, which means that as you scale up to bigger and bigger bombs.  More and more of the bomb's energy just ends up uselessly expended into the upper atmosphere or out into space, instead of into the target, because you're having to detonate the bombs farther and farther away.

People misunderstand the concept of radiation, but basically there are two categories of things we think of as ""radiation"":  electromagnetic waves and energetic particles. EM waves are the same thing as light, and they include radio, microwave, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays.  Of those, UV, x-rays, and esp. Gamma can be harmful to humans at relatively low intensities.  The atmosphere mostly screens them and protects us.  Some UV slips through, which is why sunscreen is a thing.  The other category of ""radiation"" is the emission of charged particles: electrons and protons, mostly.  Whether these are harmful just depends on how fast they're going. The sun sprays out charged particles, but the Earths magnetic field catches most of that before it reaches the surface. Of both kinds, if the radiation has enough energy to knock electrons off of atoms, it is called ""ionizing"" radiation.  Non ionizing radiation is literally incapable of harming you. Ionizing radiation can, but your body heals itself, so to do lasting damage, you need either long or intense exposure. The sun's output varies a bit, but not THAT much, and Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field screens most harmful radiation.  The symptoms you're describing couldn't come from solar output.

","if you radiate something into all directions equally, you radiate across a spherical surface. the surface area of that is ~r² so the intensity must decrease like 1/r² just by continuity (what arrives at some r-distant spherical surface must be what was radiated at the source, it can't have increased on the way).

What is the most probable physical distance between you and a random person on the internet?,,"I imagine you'll need to provide a specific starting point before anybody can answer that question. Simplest answer would be total land area divided by population: per Google, 510.1m/7.442b = 0.0685 people per sq. km. EDIT: Ah, that's not quite right, that'd be average distance to nearest person at all. You'd need to multiply that by the percentage of people online at any given moment (best answer I could find after a brief search: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/18392/how-much-percentage-of-total-internet-users-are-online-at-any-given-moment). If we go with an even larger number to improve the odds, we'll say 80 million online at any one time. That accounts for 1.07% of the population, so we multiply 0.0685 by 0.0107 to get 0.00073295 people per sq. km. Inverting that gives us the total area, and circularizing that area means at some point within roughly 21km of your location will be another internet user. Of course, that's not accounting for areas that have zero effective population.

What are p-values? What would it mean to go from a p-value of 0.05 to 0.005?,"A month ago, Nature made waves by publishing a commentary that the standard p-value should be changed from 0.05 to 0.005. If my intro to statistics covered p-values, I have completely forgotten, and the description in the commentary is abstract for me.    What are p-values? Is the last panel of this XKCD comic accurate? Why is the standard 0.05?  Is it related to the fact that 95% of a normal distribution is within two standard deviations from the mean? What would the new standard mean in practical terms?  Would it wreak havoc with the current social sciences?   (cross-poted to /r/explainlikeimfive/ and /r/askscience) ","EDIT for clarity:  The proposal under consideration is about changing how we interpret p-values.  So I need to go through what p-values are, then we can talk about the proposed change to a threshold called alpha that is used when we interpret p-values.   The p-value is the likelihood of getting data at least as unlikely as the data you actually got, given that the null hypothesis is true.  If you leave out any part of that definition, you are not talking about p-values and you will mess up in your reasoning (and I would ding you points on your exam, I used to teach intro statistics). Null hypothesis testing is a probabilistic version of proof by counterexample.  You assume something, you show that your data is very unlikely given that assumption, and that provides evidence that your assumption is false. For example, you might assume that your drug is no better than placebo (is equally likely to cure patients).  Then you administer the drug to a bunch of patients, and the placebo to a bunch more patients, and you compare how many patients were cured.  If more of the patients who got the drug get better, then you have evidence against the null hypothesis that they're the same.  But, if roughly similar numbers of patients were cured, then you haven't shown anything at all; maybe your drug isn't better, or maybe you just didn't have enough patients to prove anything. The bigger the difference between the two, the smaller the p-value, because it's less likely the drug and placebo are the same if they cure different numbers of people. The more people you have in the study, the smaller the p-value, because who gets better has an element of chance, and you might randomly have some placebo people get better on their own.  If there's no element of chance, you don't really need p-values; it'll just be really obvious, since one thing is always better.  P-values are for when you cannot tell by eye because there's too much data and the difference is too small, or when you want to prove the difference to someone. In practice, we want to make up our minds at some point, even though this whole thing is probabilistic.  To do that, we say that if the p-value is below a certain threshold (EDIT for clarity: this threshold is called alpha; the proposal under consideration is lowering alpha from 0.05 to 0.005), we reject the null hypothesis.  If you designed your experiment right, if the null hypothesis is false, then some other hypothesis of interest must be true, and then your experiment will show support for that other hypothesis.   Lowering that threshold is demanding more evidence before we are willing to reject the null hypothesis.  It basically says how often we are willing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually true.  Going back to the drug example, if we insist on a p of 0.05, that means that out of every 20 drug trials where we showed the drug is better than placebo, we will be wrong one time and the study didn't really show them to be different EDIT where the drug isn't better than placebo, we'll average one study that incorrectly finds that the drug is better (a false positive). If we ask for a p-value of 0.005, then we'll only be wrong 1 in 200 drug trials.  The threshold is essentially arbitrary; the 2 standard deviations thing is probably why that particular threshold was picked, yes, it makes it really easy to calculate since we can almost always assume an approximately normal distribution when doing these tests. Given just how many drug trials are performed, that might be a good thing to do; we don't want to approve a drug that doesn't actually do anything!  All drugs have side effects, and all drugs cost money, so drugs that don't do anything are bad. Now, if you've been paying attention, you might note that the p-value just talks about the likelihood of the null hypothesis.  And we don't actually care about the null hypothesis at all! We want to know if our hypothesis is correct, not if our null hypothesis is wrong.   This is a fundamental limitation of p-values and the philosophy of statistics that spawned them, because that philosophy does not really believe in probabilities, only proportions.  So it isn't about the probability of a study being wrong, it's about the proportion of studies that we're willing to accept being wrong in a certain way.  Asking about the probability of a hypothesis is a nonsense question; hypotheses must be either true or false. The other philosophy of statistics is perfectly happy to assign probabilities to hypotheses, with the probability representing our own uncertainty about whether the hypothesis is true or false.  In reality, it's one or the other, but since we don't know, probabilities are a great way to measure our uncertainty. Unfortunately the other philosophy of statistics often involves math that was untractable before computers, and the p-value philosophy had a very aggressive advocate, and so p-values became extremely popular, even though 99% of the people using them are using them incorrectly because they forget that the p-value is the probability of the data GIVEN THAT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS CORRECT.  They leave off that part and just treat the p-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is correct.   This ignores the probability of the null hypothesis given everything else you know, which is what you need to transform from what the p-value actually is to what people think it is.  And if the hypothesis your testing is deeply unlikely to be true, which is extremely common since there are many, many possible hypotheses, then you need WAY more evidence before you decide to assign high probability to it, and just taking the p-value will mess you up rather badly.   This is all also ignoring the fact that if you really want to reject the null hypothesis, you can just run 20 studies and one of them will come up rejecting just by chance (at a p-value of 0.05).  Going to 0.005 would require 200 studies to get one to come up by chance.   And there are many, many, many ways to fiddle with your data to turn one dataset into 20 datasets, find one that rejects, and then not really talk about the other 19.  Or to otherwise get a low p-value when you shouldn't.  I've seen analyses where the math in a paper would reject the null hypothesis something like 60% of the time for totally random data.   So, if we lower to 0.005, it will be harder to publish papers, because papers only get accepted if they say ""we rejected the null hypothesis (which is taken to mean 'my hypothesis was right')""; saying 'we failed to reject the null' is taken as 'my study didn't show anything and was a giant waste of time'.   Whether this would be catastrophic, I couldn't tell you; it will certainly be bad for labs publishing papers about results that aren't real.

Why Dimensional Analysis / Buckingham Pi Theorem Works?,"I know that we can use dimensional analysis to experimentally correlate several variables and to reduce the amount of experiment that you need to do to determine those correlation. I also know that it can be used to scale things up. Example: http://www-mdp.eng.cam.ac.uk/web/library/enginfo/aerothermal_dvd_only/aero/fprops/dimension/node6.html In the example above, we want to study how drag (F) is effected by fluid velocity (v), viscosity (mu), density (rho) and diameter (D). Using dimensional analysis / Buckingham Pi Theorem, we can reduce the variables into Drag Coefficient and Reynold numbers. But why is this valid? Why does Buckingham Pi Theorem led to a conclusion that increasing fluid velocity and increasing fluid density will have the same effect on the drag coefficient because both conditions led to the same Reynolds Number? Buckingham Pi Theorem did not take into account any fundamental principles. Every readings I encountered only explained why dimensional analysis is necessary and how to do it. I never found any resources that tried to explain why Buckingham Pi Theorem is justified. ","Not to put words in your mouth, but I think your main question is ""How do we make the jump from Buckingham Pi to Reynold's number?"" At least, that's what I've always struggled with. It's really just an oversimplification textbooks and professors use when teaching aerodynamics. It is entirely possible to create non-dimensional numbers that aren't helpful in a given problem. Reynold's number is actually the result of a lot of experimentation and doesn't flow directly from Buckingham Pi. Buckingham Pi is the proof that the set of non-dimensional numbers including Reynold's number is sufficient to scale the system. It may have also been helpful in selecting a few different non-dimensional numbers to experiment with. In short, the experimental results of Reynold's number and mathematical proof of Buckingham Pi combine to give you the relationship you're looking for, but it is often taught that one led directly to the other.

Why are fires a major problem in the western United States but not so much in the forests of the east or midwest?,"At first I was thinking it may be related to moisture levels, but the PNW is obviously having serious fires right now, where it rains frequently. Is it the sheer expanse of forest present out west that raises the chances of serious fires?  ","Western forests are rather different from Eastern forests.  One of the key differences is in the way that they recycle nutrients; in Eastern forests, materials decay, where in Western forests, they recycle through fire.  Now, when forests are allowed to burn on a regular cycle, these fires are low heat surface fires that are not destructive.  Based on fire scars, the natural burn cycle in the Sierra Nevadas was about every 20 years.  This is frequent enough to clear out the fuel lying on the forest floor and any underbrush.   Tree species here are adapted to survive fire; compare the thick bark of a Ponderosa Pine to something like a Birch.  Some species even specially adapted to propagate during forest fires and have seritonous cones that only open in that much heat. However, this all stopped in the 1910s with the advent of humans and fire suppression.  Now instead of forests burning out the fuels, they're allowed to sit and accumulate.  Fires that do happen have significantly more fuel and underbrush has been allowed to grow creating ladder fuel that turns surface fires into crown fires.  Fires are infinitely more destructive, killing everything in the burn path, and destroying things all the way down to mineral soil.

"[Seismology] Someone on twitter was claiming the earthquake in Mexico might be related to Houston, Tx sinking 2 cm, is there any truth in this?","Obviously, I have no idea about seismology, so I need to ask the question in a number of phases  Would City sized areas of the earth sink noticeably (a couple cm) under flood water? Does it happen? If that is possible, did Houston really sink 2 cm (or any other measurable value that we figured out) Would such a sinking possibly cause an earthquake? Bonus: If Houston did indeed sink, or if any other city sinks after flooding, does it ever rise back up?  Thanks "," 1 Would City sized areas of the earth sink noticeably (a couple cm) under flood water? Does it happen? 2 If that is possible, did Houston really sink 2 cm (or any other measurable value that we figured out)  Yes, your twitter friend is likely referring to this map (top image in this story) produced by the Nevada Geodetic Lab. What you're seeing is vertical motion (in particular downward vertical motion) measured by GPS stations post Harvey caused by the weight of the flood waters. What remains unclear is how exactly this surface lowering was accommodated, namely was it caused by 'flexure' of the earths crust (i.e. elastic deformation of the crust that will at least partially recover after the load is removed) or compaction (i.e. closing of pore spaces within the underlying sediment). As that article nicely points out, we see small changes (mm to cm) of surface elevation change in relation to water content changes all the time in similar data, but these are usually on a seasonal cycle as groundwater or storage of water in lakes/glaciers/etc change over the course of a wet-to-dry seasonal cycle.  3 Would such a sinking possibly cause an earthquake?  Not likely in this region and definitely not in the sense that the flooding in Houston had anything to do with the recent M8 Mexican earthquake. There has been evidence that in tectonically active regions, seasonal changes in water balance can influence the timing of small magnitude earthquakes (e.g. this study showing this in California). The important bits here are that 1) this is very local in that the stress changes caused by seasonal variation in water storage are influencing seismicity rates on essentially adjacent fault systems and 2) these are influencing the timing of earthquakes and statistics of when particular types of events happen via small stress changes, but these are earthquakes that would already happen because of build up of tectonic stresses (i.e. the stress changes from the seasonal water variations are the last little nudge, but virtually all of the stress released in these events is built up from plate motions). In the case of the M8 Mexican earthquake, the flooding in Houston is WAY too far away to in anyway influence that and the Mexico earthquake is in no way surprising (it happened on a subduction zone, where virtually all large magnitude M8 or greater earthquakes happen, though this one is interesting as it appears to be caused by deformation/bending of the subducting plate as opposed to on the interface between the two plates).  4 Bonus: If Houston did indeed sink, or if any other city sinks after flooding, does it ever rise back up?  This goes back to whether the surface lowering was caused by compaction or deformation of the earth's crust, and at this point we don't know. If it's compaction, there is no force to reopen pore space so that's permanent. If it's deformation, some of it may be recovered. In an idealized scenario where flexure of earth's crust due to a load is accommodated by elastic deformation of a homogeneous material (imagine putting a weight on a stretched rubber sheet) all of the deformation would be recovered when the load is removed. In the real world, the crust is not totally elastic so some of this deformation (if it is deformation as opposed to compaction) could be permanent. We will be able to tell with continued measurements with GPS as the floodwaters recede as we measure whether the surface rebounds or does not.

If we are recreating a process much much hotter than the sun in a fusion reactor, why would a containment fail still be considered safer than a fission reactor, other than the obvious radiation issue?

At what point does the speed of air moving over a surface start heating from friction rather than cooling by carrying away heat?,,"Aerodynamic heating is, in most if not all circumstances, caused by compression and not by friction. This principle is very pronounced in things like diesel engines and fire pistons, which use compression heating to ignite a fuel. Any object moving through the atmosphere compresses the air in front of it, causing it to heat up. At low speeds this is negligible,see Bernoulli's Law, dynamic pressure is 1/2 density multiplied by velocity squared. Similar to Bernoulli's law for pressure we can calculate a parameter called Total Temperature, which is the highest possible temperature that an airflow can cause. The equation for total temperature is: T_t = T_local * (1 + a M2 ) Where M is the Mach number of the flow, and a is a constant of approximately 0.2. The local and total temperatures are measured in Kelvin. Looking at this formula we see that, flying at the speed of sound, M=1, the air will be heated by, at the most, 20%. At standard sea level conditions this is a 60 Kelvin increase. At altitude the local temperature tends to be 50 or 60 Kelvin colder than at sea level, so your plane will hardly notice anything. Since the relation is quadratic the total temperature rapidly increases at higher speeds. At Mach 2 the total temperature is almost twice the air temperature, which is generally considered as the point at which designers have to start accounting for it in the design and materials used in the aircraft.  Do note that these extreme temperatures only occur at the front of the aircraft and wings, where the compression occurs. The flow past the aircraft fuselage and wing surfaces will only be partially compressed, and therefore only partially heated. ",15,askscience,87% ,Wed Sep 6 21:24:04 2017 UTC,5,LBoss9001,385,2242,
Any studies/data on global temperature change that's separated by latitude?,"I am frequently dismissed whenever I try explaining the catastrophic possibilities of a global 1-degree temperature change. Is this temperature change evenly distributed, or do some latitudes experience a greater change than others?

This figure is the temperature anomaly from Jan-Mar (2016) with respect to a 1961-1990 baseline, and you can see the exaggerated warming in the Arctic. The precise cause is still disputed, but certainly an important factor is the ice-albedo feedback. Arctic amplification has consequence for the weather beyond the Arctic.

On a side note, another reason why 1C of mean warming is important is because that implies a shift the ""normal distribution"" of temperatures. What this means is that at the extreme ends of the distribution, the ""tails"", a small 1C change in the mean can lead to a large increase in the number of extreme events, and it's the extreme events that are most dangerous for humans.

What is that clicking sound you hear when you swallow?,,"Could be a couple things, but what you are probably hearing is the opening of the Eustachian tubes. The basic structure of the ear is as follows.  The outer ear consists of the ear canal to the ear drum. It has nothing but air in it (well, and some wax) The middle ear runs from the ear drum to the tympanic membrane. There are 3 little bones in there that transfer the vibration of the ear drum to the tympanic membrane. The middle ear is also filled with air. The inner ear is the fluid filled part. There are little hairs in there that detect the vibrations in the fluid and send the info to the brain via the auditory nerve.  Now, the air pressure around you isn't constant. It can be higher or lower. For the outer ear, this is no problem as the direct connection to the atmosphere keeps everything at the same pressure. But that middle ear is between 2 membranes, so can't directly equalize pressure with the air. That's where the Eustachian tubes come into play. They run from the middle ear to the throat and can open to equalize the pressure in the middle ear. When you get on an airplane and it takes off, the pressure drops and your ears pop. That's the Eustachian tubes opening. Chewing and swallowing can also open the tubes, so that's probably the clicking you're hearing.

Why does the Inverse Compton Effect prevent the atmosphere from lighting up from an atomic explosion?,"So Inverse Compton Effect is that a charged particle and give some of its energy to a photon, and somehow that prevents the atmosphere from lighting up in an atomic explosion. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_nuclear_explosions ","The practical result of the Inverse Compton Effect is that high-energy electrons lose energy (by scattering low-energy photons). The electrons in question are attached to the atoms you are trying to fuse (e.g., nitrogen, if you are imagining the atmosphere burning). It's another way to say, ""the nitrogen atoms are going to be cooled because they are getting hit with all of these low-energy photons that are going to remove some of that energy, so they won't fuse."" This is a general problem with thermonuclear reactions in situations where the number of photons created is just astounding. It doesn't mean they're impossible, but it a form of energy loss that has to be accounted for (in a thermonuclear weapon, high compression, for example, helps counteract the effect; in the atmosphere, the fuel density is too diffuse for it to spread). As the cited report puts it:  Propagation of the reaction demands that the energy production in each newly entered region exceed the losses from that region. The energy appears in the form of kinetic energy of particles which are products of energetic nuclear reactions. The product particles, through collisions, share their energy with the particles of the air and help maintain the temperature. On the other hand, the share of the energy given the electrons is rapidly radiated way. This constitutes the chief energy loss. The radiation cannot help to maintain temperature because of the great transparency of air, and because, even if the heated volume is great enough to ""contain"" the radiation, the heat capacity of space for radiation is so great that the energy produced in the reaction is many orders of magnitude too small to maintain the needed radiation temperature.  The bolded part refers to inverse Compton reactions. It's an important part of the energy loss, but it's worth noting that it is part of an overall ""system"" that explains why it can't happen in that situation.

Why is the impact from being hit while wearing a bulletproof vest so much worse than the recoil from a rifle?,"From my understanding, recoil is the force the bullet exerts on the mass of the gun, and the impact felt by the person being hit is the energy of the traveling projectile, spread through the mass of the vest. The force of the bullet is the same in both cases, so why is the reported damage so different? ","The butt of rifle is designed to spread the foot pounds evenly across the shooter's shoulder. Conversely, the bullet is intended to concentrate all of its force in a very concentrated area. Even with a bulletproof vest, the force is distributed unevenly, strongest at the point of impact. In short, the bulletproof vest does not distribute the foot pounds as effectively as the butt of a rifle.  ",35,askscience,92% ,Thu Sep 7 01:14:38 2017 UTC,42,HelviusCinna,23,6,
Is it possible to achieve a fusion reaction in a laboratory setting using only protium?,"In most man-made fusion reactions, deuterium/tritium is the most common substance used, but is it possible to achieve fusion in a laboratory setting with normal hydrogen? If so, would this require more energy to do? ","The Coulomb barrier is a much stronger function of Z than A, so the Coulomb barrier for protons, deuterons, and tritons are all essentially the same. The only nontrivial reaction you can have between two protons (at least below the threshold for production of new particles) is p + p -> d + e+ + νe. This is the very first reaction in the stellar pp chain. Since a neutrino and a charged lepton are produced, this reaction involves the weak force. Since the weak force is very weak on nuclear physics scales, it has a very low probability of occurring. It's the rate-limiting step in the pp chain, because it's slow and it's necessary to produce neutrons. This reaction has a small positive Q-value, which means that it produces a little bit of energy. So overall this reaction is very unfavorable. DD and DT fusion reactions happen with much greater probability, have the same Coulomb barrier, and release a larger amount of energy.

"Why do Ammonites seem to be the most common fossil, and why are they referenced so often to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, compared to other species who went extinct?",,"While I wouldn't say ammonites are ""the most common fossil” (although they might be in the rocks in your area), they certainly are a common fossil for the marine sedimentary rocks ranging from at least the Permian to the K-T extinction.  What makes ammonites important? Well, they have all the characteristics of an important group of index fossils. Index fossils are special, and sought after because they provide reliable time markers within a rock sequence. A good group of index fossils will:  Have a wide spatial range – ammonites were pretty much global within the world’s oceans, and marine rocks make up most of the worlds sedimentary record.  Have easily fossilisable and uniquely recogniseable hard parts - Ammonites have hard shells which are distinct for each species, unlike squids for instance, so check that! Have a wide temporal range (as a group) within which occur a wide variety of distinct & recognisable and rapidly changing species with a definite time range may be recognised. Ammonites have all of this, allowing the recognition of most of their numerous species to translate into a time stamp (example). Be physically numerous when present, at least some of the time. As you have stated, this is the case in several rock assemblages, including the ones where you live (myself, I live in an area too old to contain ammonites).  So …. Because of all that, geologists will pay strong attention to the ammonite assemblages in their rocks (when they are lucky enough to have them) in order to know what is their age and figure out where in the stratigraphy they are. This entails that they will be referenced a lot, almost in a mandatory fashion, as they are in a way the reference calendar we are using when working in those rocks. And their disappearance at the K-T extinction deprives us of a reliable and useful tool. They are missed. There are other groups of fossils which I would say are at least as important as ammonites for other time periods or environments, such as: graptolites, brachiopods, and foraminifers.

What is the speed of breaking glass?,"To our eyes, glass shatters instantaneously, but there has to be a propagation speed...... ","While you might think that the fracture would spread at the speed of sound in glass (because that's the speed at which pressure changes propagate), a fracture in something like glass typically grows more slowly than that (although in certain materials, the fracture has been shown to actually move faster than the speed of sound - or at least, a certain definition of the speed of sound, because different waves travel at different speeds).  Fracture is something that isn't fully and accurately modeled yet in mechanics of materials so the most accurate data on this comes from measurement. And fracture speeds are not independent of material shape and loading.  Nevertheless, the speed of fracture in glass is about 1500 m/s or about 5000 ft/s (or about 5400 kph or 3300 mph).

How long would you need to survive to out live a zombie apocalypse?,"Zombies are just decomposing bodies out in the elements, so how long would you need to survive before they reach a level of decomp that they no longer pose a threat of being able to chase you down and attack you? ","I'll just step in while we wait for a researcher with expertise in zombyism to show up.  Zombies are just decomposing bodies out in the elements  Well ... for one thing, they are fictive ""decomposing bodies out in the elements"" ... for the purpose of your question, it matters. It matters because there are so many different biological models out there for zombyism that it may not necessarily be so. These include viral infection with varying degrees of physical mortification (28 days), brain controlling parasites (Night of the Creeps), partial brain destruction with preservation of living function (the Walking Dead), actual death and colonisation by hive organisms (Demon, by John Varley) and dead and resurrection through unknown means (the Living dead).  On one hand, this is a topic with a surprisingly large amount of research behind it. On the other hand, that research exposes the fatal flaw within the question: the answer depends on what biological & epidemiological models you use for the zombie epidemic. The answers range from a few months to impossibility, depending on the parameters selected for the biological and epidemiological model.

Why can't I see around a corner?,"Think about a mirror, if you tilt the mirror, you can see light that was directly repelled from the mirror and into your eyes effectively allowing you to see light that bounced off objects not in your field of view. But why can we only see from that one ""Bounce"" and not the previous bounce, maybe light hit a TV then bounced off a dresser then hit the mirror, but only the dresser is shown in the mirror. Another example might be a square room with a wall in the middle that is too tall to look over, one side has a light source, the other side doesn't, it's dark. The dark side gets indirect light from a slit at the top of the wall connecting the other room. Why can I not see the room where the light came from if I'm in the dark room. ","There are two types of reflection, specular and diffuse.  A mirror has specular reflection, it reflects all light at the same angle that hits it. That is why you can see an reflected image, the light rays continue taking the same path relative to each other after bouncing off the mirror. A diffuse reflection, however, reflects light that hits it in a random direction (or rather many random directions at once). That means every point on the object is reflecting light rays from every light source (light emitter or light reflector) in the room at once, so the individual light rays take random paths to reach you. Most objects have diffuse reflections rather than specular reflections. That means that the light coming from different directions gets all mixed together, making it impossible to form an image.

Why do we use gasoline when methanol fuel, which is what F1 cars use, is more environmentally friendly? ","Methanol is more costly than gasoline and is easily contaminated with water. It's less energy dense, because there are 4 hydrogen molecules and one oxygen for every carbon, while gasoline has about 2 hydrogens for every carbon, so a gallon of gasoline has twice the energy of a gallon of methanol. Methanol has to be chemically produced, while gasoline is refined from oil. ",7,askscience,64% ,Wed Sep 6 14:17:19 2017 UTC,16,JohnMarston208,1604,5210,
How inaccurate are typically earthquake magnitude estimates?,"Estimates of the magnitude of the earthquake created by the most recent North Korean nuclear test range from 5.6 to 6.4. That's a range of 0.8, corresponding to a factor 15 uncertainty in energy release. Is an uncertainty this big typical for an earthquake of this size? ","There are two things at play here: 1) Initial Estimates != Final Reviewed Magnitudes: There is a difference between initial estimates of earthquake magnitudes (which often appear within minutes of an event) and final, reviewed determinations of earthquake magnitudes (which usually take a few days to determine). Most agencies, like the USGS, which report earthquake magnitudes do give an estimate of the uncertainty. If you look at the detailed description of the North Korea nuclear test, you'll see that the uncertainty is listed as 0.0 (though this is rounded, as you'll see shortly) and the magnitude is reported as 6.3. Initial estimates of earthquake magnitudes are often determined automatically from a limited number of observations (i.e. data from a limited number of seismometers) seconds-minutes after seismic waves are first recorded. Over a few days, more observations are put together, often requiring the sharing of data between different institutions and organizations across multiple countries, and the measurement of magnitudes of events get more precise and more accurate. This is true for earthquakes whether they are natural or man-made as in the case of the North Korea nuclear test. 2) There are different types of magnitude measures: Depending on how you measure earthquake magnitude (i.e. what part of the seismic wave do you use, how do you scale it, etc) there are a few standard ways of reporting magnitudes. If you look at the list of magnitudes as determined by the USGS (same link as above, but click on the 'mangitudes' tab), you'll see that the 6.3 magnitude is for body waves (abbreviated mb) with an uncertainty of 0.02 (there's that rounding), but that the moment magnitude (in this case abbreviated as Mww, which is one subtype of moment magnitudes) is 5.5 with an error of 0.066. For the most part, for natural earthquakes, it's more common to report moment magnitudes (these magnitudes are roughly equal to the old 'Richter Scale' magnitudes). I don't why people are using the body wave (mb) magnitude in this case, someone with a stronger background in seismology than myself might be able to answer that, but the takeway is that the range of magnitudes does not reflect uncertainty, just different ways of reporting an earthquakes magnitude.
